<h2>SEA CHANGE.</h2>

<h3>PART I.<br />
THE RAINBOW.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> London nightfall is a delirium of bustle, in
the country the coming of a dream. The town
scatters a dust of city men over its long and lighted
streets, powders its crying thoroughfares with
gaily dressed creatures who are hidden, like bats,
during the hours of day, opens a thousand defiant
yellow eyes that have been sealed in sleep, throws
off its wrapper and shows its elaborate toilet. The
country grows demure and brown, most modest in
the shadows. Labourers go home along the damp
and silent lanes with heavy weariness. The parish
clergyman flits like a blackbird through the twinkling
village. Dogs bark from solitary farms. A
beautiful and soft depression fills all the air like
incense or like evening bells. But whether night
reveals or hides the activities of men it changes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
them most curiously. The difference between
man in day, man in night, is acute.</p>

<p>The arrival of darkness always meant something
to the Rev. Peter Uniacke, whose cure of souls
now held him far from the swarming alleys and
the docks in which his early work had been done.
He seldom failed to give this visitor, so strange
and soft-footed, some slight greeting. Sometimes
his welcome was a sigh, sometimes a prayer, sometimes
a clenching of the hands, a smile, a pause in
his onward walk. Looking backward along his
past he could see his tall figure in many different
places, aware of the first footfalls of the night, now
alone and thinking of night's allegory of man's
end, now in company, when the talk insensibly
changed its character, flowing into deeper, more
mysterious or confidential channels. Peter Uniacke
had listened to informal confessions, too, as the
night fell, confessions of sin that at first surprised
him, that at last could no longer surprise him.
And he had confessed himself, before the altar of
the twilight, and had wondered why it is that sometimes
Nature seems to have the power of absolution,
even as God has it.</p>

<p>Now, at the age of thirty-two, he heard the footsteps
of night on a windy evening of November.
They drew near to the wall of the churchyard in
which stood the sturdy and rugged building where
now he ministered, on a little isle set lonely in a
harsh and dangerous northern sea. He listened
to them, leaning his arms along this wall, by which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the grey and sleepless waves sang loudly. In the
churchyard, growing gradually dim and ethereal,
were laid many bodies from which the white vampires
of the main had sucked out the souls. Here
mouldered fisher lads, who had whistled over the
nets, and dreamed rough dreams of winning island
girls and breeding hardy children. Here reposed
old limbs of salty mariners, who had for so long
defied the ocean that when they knew themselves
taken at the last, they turned their rugged faces
down to their enemy with a stony and an ironic
wonder. And here, too, among these cast-up
bodies of the drowned, lay many women who had
loved the prey of the sea, and kissed the cheeks
turned acrid by its winds and waters. Some of
them had died from heart-sickness, cursing the sea.
Some had faded, withering like the pale sand roses
beside the sea. Some had lived to old age by
empty hearths, in the sound of the sea.</p>

<p>Inscriptions faded upon the stones that lay above
them. Texts of comfort in which the fine, salt
films crept, faint verses of sweet hymns defiled by
the perching sea-birds, old rhymes like homely
ejaculations of very simple hearts, sank into the
gathering darkness on every hand. The graves
seemed murmuring to the night: "Look on me,
I hold a lover;" "And I&mdash;I keep fast a maiden;"
"And within my arms crumbles a little child
caught by the sea;" "And I fold a mother, whose
son is in the hideous water foliage of the depths
of the sea;" "And I embrace an old captain whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the sea loved even in his hollow age." The last
inscription that stood clear to Peter Uniacke's
eyes in the dying light ran thus:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;"><p>"Here lies the body of Jack Pringle, cast up by
the sea on December 4th, 1896. He was boy on
the schooner 'Flying Fish.' His age seventeen.
'Lead kindly Light.'"</p></div>

<p>Uniacke watched this history go into the maw of
the darkness, and when it was gone he found himself
environed by the cool sea noises which seemed
to grow louder in the night, wondering whether
the "Kindly Light" was indeed leading on Jack
Pringle, no longer boy on the schooner "Flying
Fish," but&mdash;what? The soul of a fisher lad, who
had kissed his girl, and drunk his glass, and told
many a brave and unfitting tale, and sworn many
a lusty oath, following some torch along the radiant
ways of Heaven! Was that it? Uniacke had, possibly,
preached now and then that so indeed it
was. Or, perhaps, was the light-hearted and careless
living lad caught fast, like sunk wreckage, in
the under sea of Hell, where pain is like a living
fire in the moving dimness? "His age seventeen."
Could that be true and God merciful?
With such thoughts, Uniacke greeted the falling
of night. In the broad daylight, full of the songs
and of the moving figures of his brawny fisher
folk, he had felt less poetically uncertain. He
had said like men at sea, "All's well!" More, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
had been able to feel it. But now he leaned on
the churchyard wall and it was cold to his arms.
And the song of the sea was cold in his ears. And
the night lay cold upon his heart. And his mind&mdash;in
the grim, and apparently unmeaning way of
minds set to sad music in a sad atmosphere&mdash;crept
round and round about the gravestone of
this boy; bereft of boyhood so early, of manhood
ere he won to it, and carried so swiftly into
mystery beyond the learning of all philosophy.
Ignorance, in jersey and dripping sea-boots, set
face to face with all knowledge, and that called a
tragedy!</p>

<p>Yet now to Peter Uniacke it was tragedy, and
his own situation, left in the safety of ignorance
preaching to the ignorant, tragedy too, because of
the night, and the winds and the sea noises, and
the bareness of this Isle.</p>

<p>Beyond the church a light shone out, and a
bearded shadow towered and dwindled upon a
white blind. Uniacke, a bachelor, and now almost
of necessity a recluse, entertained for the present
a visitor. Remembering the substance of the
shadow he opened the churchyard gate, threaded
his way among the gravestones, and was quickly
at the Vicarage door. As he passed within, a
yellow glow of lamplight and of firelight streamed
into the narrow passage from a chamber on the
left hand, and he heard his piano, surprised to
learn that it could be taught to deliver passionately
long winding melodies from <i>Tristan and Isolde</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Uniacke laid down his hat and stick and entered
his sitting-room, still companioned by the shadowy
thought-form of the boy of the schooner "Flying
Fish," who seemed to tramp at his side noiselessly,
in long sea-boots that streamed with the salt
water.</p>

<p>The man at the piano turned round, showing a
handsome and melancholy face, and eyes that
looked as if they were tired, having seen too many
men and deeds and cities.</p>

<p>"I make myself at home, you see," he said, "as
I hope you will some day in my studio, when you
visit me at Kensington."</p>

<p>Uniacke smiled, and laid his hand on a bell which
tinkled shrewishly.</p>

<p>"It is a great treat for me to hear music and a
voice not my own in this room," he answered.
"Are you ready for tea?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, I painted till it was dark. I was
able to paint."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that."</p>

<p>"When it was too dim to see, and too cold to
feel the brush between my fingers, I came back in
the twilight to my new roof tree. I am thankful
to be out of the inn, yet I've stayed in worse
places in Italy and Greece. But they were gilded
by the climate."</p>

<p>He sat down by the fire and stretched his limbs.
Uniacke looked at him rather curiously. To the
lonely clergyman it was a novel experience to play
host to a man of distinction, to a stranger who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
had filled the world with his fame years ago.
Three days before, in one of his island walks,
Uniacke had come upon a handsome bearded man
in a lane full of mud, between bleak walls of stone.
The man stopped him courteously, asked if he
were not the clergyman of the Isle, and, receiving
an affirmative reply, began to make some enquiries
as to lodging accommodation.</p>

<p>"My name is Sir Graham Hamilton," he said
presently.</p>

<p>Uniacke started with surprise and looked at the
stranger curiously. He had read much of the
great sea painter, of his lonely wanderings, of his
melancholy, of his extraordinary house in Kensington,
and, just recently, of his wretched condition
of health, which, it was said, had driven him suddenly
from London, the papers knew not whither.</p>

<p>"I thought you were ill," he blurted out.</p>

<p>"I am not very well," the painter said simply,
"and the inn here is exceedingly uncomfortable.
But I want to stay. This is the very home of the
sea. Here I find not merely the body of the sea
but also its soul."</p>

<p>"There are no good lodgings, I am afraid,"
said the clergyman. "Nobody ever wants to lodge
here, it seems."</p>

<p>"I do. Well, then, I must keep on at the inn."</p>

<p>"Come to stay with me, will you?" Uniacke
suddenly said. "I have a spare room. It is scarcely
ever occupied. My friends find this island a far
cry, except in the height of summer. I shall be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
glad of your company and glad to make you as
comfortable as I can."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," said the painter, hesitating.
"But I scarcely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come as my guest," said the clergyman, reddening
slightly.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I will. And some day you must
come to me in London."</p>

<p>Now the painter was installed at the Vicarage,
and blessed, each hour, his happy escape from the
inn, whose walls seemed expanded by the forcible
and athletic smell of stale fish.</p>

<p>Uniacke's servant girl brought in the tea. The
two men had it by the fire. Presently Hamilton
said:</p>

<p>"Nightfall is very interesting and curious here."</p>

<p>"I find it so almost everywhere," Uniacke said.</p>

<p>"Yes. It can never be dull. But here, in winter
at least, it is extraordinarily&mdash;" he paused for the
exactly right word, in a calm way that was peculiar
to him and that seemed to emphasise his fine self-possession&mdash;"pathetic,
and suggestive of calamity."</p>

<p>"I have noticed that, indeed," Uniacke answered,
"and never, I think, more than to-night."</p>

<p>Hamilton looked across at him in the firelight.</p>

<p>"Where did you see it fall?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I was by the wall of the churchyard."</p>

<p>"It was you, then, whom I saw from the window.
It seemed to be a mourner looking at the
graves."</p>

<p>"I was looking at them. But nobody I care for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
deeply is buried there. The night, however, in
such an island as this, makes every grave seem
like the grave of a person one has known. It is
the sea, I daresay."</p>

<p>"So close on every hand. Why, this house of
yours might be a ship afloat a hundred miles from
land, judging by the sounds of the waves."</p>

<p>He sighed heavily.</p>

<p>"I hope the air will do you good," Uniacke remarked,
with a sudden relapse into conversational
lameness.</p>

<p>"Thank you. But sea air is no novelty to me.
Half of my life, at least, has been spent in it. I
have devoted all the best of my life, my powers,
my very soul to the service of the sea. And now,
when I am growing old, I sometimes think that I
shall hate it before I go."</p>

<p>"Hate it!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;but it has brought you fame."</p>

<p>"H'm. And wealth and a thousand acquaintances.
Yes, that's quite true. Sometimes, nevertheless,
we learn in the end to hate those who
have brought us most. Perhaps, because they
have educated us in the understanding of disappointment.
You love the sea?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't be here otherwise."</p>

<p>"I did not come here exactly because of that,"
Uniacke said slowly.</p>

<p>"No," said the painter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rather to forget something."</p>

<p>"I doubt if this is a place which could teach
one to forget. I find it quite otherwise."</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other, the elderly
painter on his height of fame, the young clergyman
in his depth of obscurity, and each felt that
there was a likeness between them.</p>

<p>"I came here to forget a woman," Uniacke said
at last, moved by a strange impulse to speak
out.</p>

<p>"Yes, I see. It is the old idea of sorrowful
men, a hermitage. I have often wondered in London,
in Rome, in Athens, whether a hermitage is
of any avail. Men went out into the desert in old
days. Legend has it that holiness alone guided
them there. All their disciples believed that.
Reading about them I have often doubted it."</p>

<p>He smiled rather coldly and cynically.</p>

<p>"You don't know what a hermitage can mean.
You have only been here three days. Besides,
you come in search of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Search!" Hamilton interrupted, with an unusual
quickness.</p>

<p>"Of work and health."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Do you care, since we are on intimate
topics, to tell me any more about yourself
and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That woman?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I loved her. She disappeared out of my life.
I don't know at all where she is, with whom, how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
she lives, anything at all about her. I don't suppose
I ever shall. She may be dead."</p>

<p>"You don't think you would know it if she
were?"</p>

<p>"How could I? Who would tell me?"</p>

<p>"Not something within you? Not yourself?"</p>

<p>Uniacke was surprised by this remark. It did
not fit in precisely with his conception of his
guest's mind, so far as he had formed one.</p>

<p>"Such an idea never occurred to me," he said.
"Do you believe that such an absolute certainty
could be put into a man's mind then, without a
reason, a scrap of evidence, a hint to eye, or
ear?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I&mdash;I want to know."</p>

<p>"That someone's dead?"</p>

<p>"That someone is not dead. How loud the sea
is getting!"</p>

<p>"It always sounds much like that at night in
winter."</p>

<p>"Does the winter not seem very long to you up
here quite alone?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"And monotonous?"</p>

<p>"Often. But we have times of keen excitement,
of violent, even of exhausting activity. I
have had to rush from the pulpit up to my shoulders
in the sea."</p>

<p>"A wreck?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there have been many. There was the
schooner 'Flying Fish.' She broke up when I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
was holding service one December morning. Only
the skipper was saved alive. And he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What of him?"</p>

<p>"He went what the people here call 'silly' from
the shock&mdash;not directly. It came on him gradually.
He would not leave the island. He would
never trust the sea again."</p>

<p>"So he's here still?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Just then the two plaintive bells of the church
began to ring on the wind.</p>

<p>"There he is!" Uniacke said.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"He's our bell-ringer. It's the only thing he
takes any pleasure in, ringing the bells for church
and at nightfall. I let him do it, poor fellow. He's
got a queer idea into his brain that his drowned
mates will hear the bells some night and make the
land, guided by the sound. When the darkness
falls he always rings for a full hour."</p>

<p>"How strange! How terrible!"</p>

<p>They sat by the fire listening to the pathetic
chime of the two bells, whose voices were almost
hidden in the loud sea voices that enveloped the
little island with their cries. Presently the painter
shifted in his armchair.</p>

<p>"There is something&mdash;I&mdash;there is something
very eerie to me in the sound of those two
bells now I know why they are ringing, and who
is ringing them," he said, with a slight irritation.
"Don't you find they affect your nerves at all?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. I like to hear them. They tell me that
one poor creature is happy. The Skipper&mdash;all we
Island folk call him so&mdash;believes he will bring his
mates safe to shore some day. And each time he
sets those bells going he thinks the happy hour is
perhaps close at hand."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow! And he is summoning the
drowned to come up out of their world."</p>

<p>They sat silent again for three or four minutes.
Then Sir Graham said:</p>

<p>"Uniacke, you have finished your tea?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir Graham."</p>

<p>"Has your day's work tired you very much?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then I wish you would do me a favour. I
want to see your skipper. Can I get into the
church?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He always leaves the door wide open
while he rings the bells&mdash;so that his mates can
come in from the sea to him."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow! Poor fellow!"</p>

<p>He got up.</p>

<p>"I shall go across to the church now," he said.</p>

<p>"I'll take you there. Wrap yourself up. It's
cold to-night."</p>

<p>"It is very cold."</p>

<p>The painter pulled a great cloak over his shoulders
and a cap down over his glittering and melancholy
eyes, that had watched for many years all
the subtle changes of the colour and the movement
of the sea. Uniacke opened the Vicarage door<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and they stood in the wind. The night was not
dark, but one of those wan and light grey nights
that seemed painted with the very hues of wind and
of cloud. It was like a fluid round about them,
and surely flowed hither and thither, now swaying
quietly, now spreading away, shredded out as water
that is split by hard substances. It was full of
noise as is a whirlpool, in which melancholy cries
resound forever. Above this noise the notes of
the two bells alternated like the voices of stars in
a stormy sky.</p>

<p>"Even living men at sea to-night would not
hear those bells," said the painter. "And the
drowned&mdash;how can they hear?"</p>

<p>"Who knows?" said the clergyman. "Perhaps
they are allowed to hear them and to offer up
prayers for their faithful comrade. I think faithfulness
is heaven in a human heart."</p>

<p>They moved across the churchyard, and all the
graves of the drowned flickered round their feet
in the gusty greyness. They passed Jack Pringle's
grave, where the "Kindly Light" lay in the stone.
When they gained the church Sir Graham saw
that the door was set wide open to the night. He
stood still.</p>

<p>"And so those dead mariners are to pass in
here," he said, "under this porch. Uniacke, cannot
you imagine the scene if they came? Those
dead men, with their white, sea-washed faces, their
dripping bodies, their wild eyes that had looked on
the depths of the sea, their hanging hands round
which the fishes had nibbled with their oval lips!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
The procession of the drowned to their faithful
captain. If I stood here long enough alone my
imagination would hear them, would hear their
ghostly boat grate its keel upon the Island beach,
and the tramp of their sodden sea-boots. How
many were there?"</p>

<p>"I never heard. Only one body was cast up,
and that is buried by the churchyard wall. Shall
we go in?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>They entered through the black doorway.
The church was very dim and smelt musty
and venerable, rather as the cover of an old and
worn Bible smells. And now that they were
within it, the bells sounded different, less magical,
more full of human music; their office&mdash;the summoning
of men to pray, the benediction of the
marriage tie, the speeding of the departed on the
eternal road&mdash;became apparent and evoked accustomed
thoughts.</p>

<p>"Where is the belfry?" said Sir Graham in a
whisper.</p>

<p>"This way. We have to pass the vestry and
go up a stone staircase."</p>

<p>Uniacke moved forward along the uncarpeted
pavement, on which his feet, in their big nailed
boots, rang harshly. The painter followed him
through a low and narrow door which gave on to
a tiny stairway, each step of which was dented and
crumbled at the uneven edge. They ascended in
the dark, not without frequent stumbling, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
heard always the bells which seemed sinking down
to them from the sky. Presently a turn brought
them to a pale ray of light which lay like a thread
upon the stone. At the same moment the bells
ceased to sound. Both Uniacke and Sir Graham
paused simultaneously, the vision of the light and
the cessation of the chimes holding them still for
an instant almost without their knowledge. There
was a silence that was nearly complete, for the
tower walls were thick, and kept the sea voices and
the blowing winds at bay. And while they waited,
involuntarily holding their breath, a hoarse and
uneven voice cried out, anxiously and hopefully
from above:</p>

<p>"Are ye comin', mates? Are ye comin'? Heave
along, boys! D'ye hear me! I'm your skipper.
Heave along!"</p>

<p>Uniacke half turned to the painter, whose face
was very white.</p>

<p>"What are ye waitin' for?" continued the voice.
"I heard ye comin'. I heard ye at the door.
Come up, I say, and welcome to ye! Welcome
to ye all, mates. Ye've been a damned long time
comin'."</p>

<p>"He thinks&mdash;he thinks&mdash;" whispered Uniacke
to his companion.</p>

<p>"I know. It's cruel. What shall we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ye've made the land just in time, mates," continued
the voice. "For there's a great gale comin'
up to-night. The 'Flying Fish' couldn't live in
her under bare poles, I reckon. I'm glad ye've
got ashore. Where are ye, I say? Where are ye?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>The sound of the voice approached the two men
on the stairs. The thread of light broadened and
danced on the stone. High up there appeared the
great figure of a man in a seaman's jersey with a
peaked cap on his head. In his broad rough hands
he held a candle, which he shaded with his fingers
while he peered anxiously and expectantly down
the dark and narrow funnel of the stairway.</p>

<p>"Hulloh!" he cried. "Hulloh, there!"</p>

<p>The hail rang down in the night. Sir Graham
was trembling.</p>

<p>"I see ye," cried the Skipper. "It's Jack, eh?
Isn't it little Jack, boys? Young monkey! Up
to his damned larks that I've reckoned up these
many nights while I've stood ringin' here! I'll
strike the life out of ye, Jack, I will. Wait till I
come down, lads, wait till I come down!"</p>

<p>And he sprang forward, his huge limbs shaking
with glad excitement. His feet missed a stair in
his hurry of approach, and throwing abroad his
hands to the stone walls of the belfry in an effort
to save himself, he let fall the candlestick. It
dropped on the stones with a dull clatter as the
darkness closed in. The Skipper, who had recovered
his footing, swore a round oath. Sir Graham
and Uniacke heard his heavy tread descending
until his breath was warm on their faces.</p>

<p>"Where are ye, lads?" he cried out. "Where
are ye? Can't ye throw a word of welcome to a
mate?"</p>

<p>He laid his hands heavily on Uniacke's shoulders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in the dark, and felt him over with an uncertain
touch.</p>

<p>"Is it Jack?" he said. "Why, what 'a ye got
on, lad? Is it Jack, I say?"</p>

<p>"Skipper," Uniacke said, in a low voice, "it's
not Jack." As he spoke he struck a match. The
tiny light flared up unevenly right in the Skipper's
eyes. They were sea-blue and blazing with eagerness
and with the pitiful glare of madness. Over
the clergyman's shoulder the pale painter with his
keen eyes swept the bearded face of the Skipper
with a rapid and greedy glance. By the time the
match dwindled and the blackness closed in again
the face was a possession of his memory. He saw
it even though it was actually invisible; the rugged
features dignified by madness, the clear, blue eyes
full of a saddening fire, and&mdash;ere the match faded&mdash;of
a horror of disappointment, the curling brown
beard that flowed down on the blue jersey. But
he had no time to dwell on it now, for a dreary
noise rose up in that confined space. It was the
great seaman whimpering pitifully in the dark.</p>

<p>"It isn't Jack," he blubbered, and they could
hear his huge limbs shaking. "Ye haven't come
back, mates, ye haven't come back. And the
great gale comin' up, the great gale comin'."</p>

<p>As the words died away, a gust of wind caught
the belfry and tore at its rough-hewn and weather-worn
stones.</p>

<p>"Let us go down," said Sir Graham, turning to
feel his way into the church.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, Skipper," said Uniacke, "come with
us."</p>

<p>He laid hold of the seaman's mighty arm and
led him down the stairs. He said nothing. On
a sudden all the life and hope had died out of
him. When they gained the grey churchyard
and could see his face again in the pale and stormy
light, it looked shrunken, peaked and childish, and
the curious elevation of madness was replaced by
the uncertainty and weakness of idiocy. He
shifted on his feet and would not meet the pitiful
glances of the two men. Uniacke touched him
on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Come to the Vicarage, Skipper," he said kindly.
"Come in and warm yourself by the fire and
have some food. It's so cold to-night."</p>

<p>But the seaman suddenly broke away and
stumbled off among the gravestones, whimpering
foolishly like a dog that cannot fight grief with
thought.</p>

<p>"The sea&mdash;ah, the hatefulness of the sea!" said
the painter, "will it ever have to answer for its
crimes before God?"</p>

<p>Uniacke and his guest sat at supper that night,
and all the windows of the Vicarage rattled in
the storm. The great guns of the wind roared
in the sky. The great guns of the surf roared on
the island beaches. And the two men were very
silent at first. Sir Graham ate little. He had
no appetite, for he seemed to hear continually in
the noises of the elements the shrill whimpering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of a dog. Surely it came from the graves outside,
from those stone breasts of the dead.</p>

<p>"I can't eat to-night," he said presently. "Do
you think that man is lingering about the church
still?"</p>

<p>They got up from the table and went over to
the fire. The painter lit a pipe.</p>

<p>"I hope not," Uniacke said, "but it is useless
attempting to govern him. He is harmless, but
he must be left alone. He cannot endure being
watched or followed."</p>

<p>"I wish we hadn't gone to the church. I can't
get over our cruelty."</p>

<p>"It was inadvertent."</p>

<p>"Cruelty so often is, Uniacke. But we ought
to look forward and foresee consequences. I feel
that most especially to-night. Remorse is the
wage of inadvertence."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he looked gloomily into the fire.
The young clergyman felt oddly certain that the
great man had more to say, and did not interrupt
his pause, but filled it in for himself by priestly
considerations on the useless illumination worldly
success seems generally to afford to the searchers
after happiness. His reverie was broken by the
painter's voice saying:</p>

<p>"I myself, Uniacke, am curiously persecuted by
remorse. It is that, or partly that, which has
affected my health so gravely, and led me away
from my home, my usual habits of life, at this season
of the year."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes?" the clergyman said, with sympathy,
without curiosity.</p>

<p>"And yet, I suppose it would seem a little matter
to most people. The odd thing is that it
assumes such paramount importance in my life;
for I'm not what is called specially conscientious,
except as regards my art, of course, and the ordinary
honourable dealings one decent man naturally
has with his fellows."</p>

<p>"Your conscience, in fact, limits its operations a
good deal, I know."</p>

<p>"Precisely. But if it will not bore you, I will
tell you something of all this."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sir Graham."</p>

<p>"How the wind shakes those curtains!"</p>

<p>"Nothing will keep it out of these island
houses. You aren't cold?"</p>

<p>"Not in body, not a bit. Well, Uniacke, do
you ever go to see pictures?"</p>

<p>"Whenever I can. That's not often now. But
when my work lay in cities I had chances which
are denied me at present."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see a picture of mine called 'A
sea urchin'?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed&mdash;that boy looking at the waves
rolling in!&mdash;who could forget him? The soul of
the sea was in his eyes. He was a human being,
and yet he seemed made of all sea things."</p>

<p>"He had never set eyes upon the sea."</p>

<p>"What?" cried Uniacke, in sheer astonishment,
"the boy who sat for that picture? Impossible!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
When I saw it I felt that you had by some happy
chance lit on the one human being who contained
the very soul of an element. No merman could
so belong of right to the sea as that boy."</p>

<p>"Who was a London model, and had never
heard the roar of waves or seen the surf break in
the wind."</p>

<p>"Genius!" the clergyman exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Uniacke," continued the painter, "I got &pound;1,000
for that picture. And I call the money now blood-money
to myself."</p>

<p>"Blood-money! But why?"</p>

<p>"I had made studies of the sea for that picture.
I had indicated the wind by the shapes of the
flying foam journeying inland to sink on the
fields. I wanted my figure, I could not find him.
Yet I was in a sea village among sea folk. The
children's legs there were browned with the salt
water. They had clear blue eyes, sea eyes;
that curious light hair which one associates with
the sea and with spun glass sometimes. But they
wouldn't do for my purpose. They were unimaginative.
As a fact, Uniacke, they knew the
sea too well. That was it. They were familiar
with it, as the little London clerk is familiar with
Fleet Street or Chancery Lane. The twin brother
of a prophet thinks prophecy boring table-talk&mdash;not
revelation. These children chucked the sea
under the chin. That didn't do for me, and for
what I wanted."</p>

<p>"I understand."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"After a great deal of search and worry I came
to this conclusion: that my purpose required of
me this&mdash;the discovery of an exceptionally imaginative
child, who was unfamiliar with the sea, but
into whose heart and brain I could pour its narrated
wonders, whose soul I could fill to the brim
with its awe, its majesty, its murmuring sweetness,
its wild romance and its inexhaustible cruelty.
I must make this child see and know, but through
the medium of words alone, of mental vision. If
I took it to the sea the imagination would be
stricken down&mdash;well, by such banalities as paddling
and catching shrimps."</p>

<p>Uniacke smiled.</p>

<p>"But on the contrary, in London, far from the
sea, I could give to the child only those impressions
of the sea that would wake in it the sort of
sea-soul I desired to print. I should have it in
my power. And a child's soul cannot be governed
by a mere painter, when a conflict arises
between him and sand-castles and crabs and
prawns and the various magicians of the kind that
obsess the child so easily and so entirely."</p>

<p>"Yes, children are conquered by trifles."</p>

<p>"And that, too, is part of their beauty. Under
this strong impression, I packed up my traps and
came back to London with the studies for my picture.
I placed them on an easel in my studio and
began my search for the child. At first I sought
this child among my cultivated friends; married
artists, musicians, highly-strung people, whose lives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
were passed in an atmosphere vibrating with quick
impressions. But I went unrewarded. The children
of such people are apt to be peevishly receptive,
but their moods are often cloudy, and I wished
for a pellucid nature. After a time I went lower
down, and I began to look about the streets for
my wonder-child."</p>

<p>"What a curious quest!" said Uniacke, leaning
forward till the firelight danced on his thin face
and was reflected in his thoughtful hazel eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was," rejoined the painter, who was
gradually sinking into his own narrative, dropping
down in the soft realm of old thoughts revived.
"It was curious, and to me, highly romantic. I
sometimes thought it was like seeking for a hidden
sea far inland, watching for the white face of
a little wave in the hard and iron city thoroughfares.
Sometimes I stopped near Victoria Station,
put my foot upon a block, and had a boot half
ruined while I watched the bootblack. Sometimes
I bought a variety of evening papers from a
ragged gnome who might be a wonder-child, and
made mistakes over the payment to prolong the
interview. I leaned against gaunt houses and
saw the dancing waifs yield their poor lives to
ugly, hag-ridden music. I endured the wailing
hymns of voiceless women on winter days in order
that I might observe the wretched ragamuffins
squalling round their knees the praise of a Creator
who had denied them everything. Ah! forgive
me!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"For some purpose that we shall all know at
last," said Uniacke gently.</p>

<p>"Possibly. In all these prospectings I was unlucky.
By chance at length I found the wonder-child
when I was not seeking him."</p>

<p>"How was that?"</p>

<p>"One day the weather, which had been cold,
changed and became warm, springlike, and alive
with showers. When it was not raining, you felt
the rain was watching you from hidden places.
You smelt it in the air. The atmosphere was very
sweet and depressing, and London was full of faint
undercurrents of romance, and of soft and rapidly
changing effects of light. I went out in the afternoon
and spent an hour in the National Gallery.
When I came out my mind was so full of painted
canvas that I never looked at the unpainted sky,
or at the vaporous Square through which streamed
the World, opening and shutting umbrellas. I
believe I was thinking over some new work of my
own, arranged for the future. Now the rain
ceased, I went down the steps and walked across
the road into the stone garden of the lions. Round
their feet played pigmy children. I heard their
cries mingling with the splash of the fountains,
but I took no notice of them. Sitting down on a
bench, I went on planning a picture&mdash;the legendary
masterpiece, no doubt. I was certainly very
deep in thought and lost to my surroundings,
for when a hand suddenly grasped my knee I was
startled. I looked up. In front of me stood a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
very dirty and atrociously-dressed boy, whose
head was decorated with a tall, muddy paper
cap, funnel-shaped and bending feebly in the
breeze. This boy was clutching my knee tightly
with one filthy hand, while with the other he
pointed to the sky on which his eyes were intently
fixed.</p>

<p>"'Look at that there rainbow!' he said. 'Look
at that there rainbow!'</p>

<p>"I glanced up and saw that the clouds had partially
broken and that London lay under a huge
and perfect coloured arch.</p>

<p>"'I never did!' continued the boy.</p>

<p>"He stared at me for an instant with the solemn
expression of one who reveals to the ignorant a
miracle. Then he took his hand from my knee,
hurried to an adjoining seat, woke up a sleeping
and partially intoxicated tramp, requested him to
observe closely the superb proceedings of Nature,
took no heed of his flooding oaths, and passed on
in the waving paper cap from seat to seat, rousing
from their dreams, and sorrows, and newspapers,
the astounded habitu&eacute;s of the Square, that they
might share his awe and happiness. Before he
had finished teaching a heavy policeman the lessons
of the sky, I knew that I had found my
wonder-child."</p>

<p>"You followed him?"</p>

<p>"I captured him in the midst of a group of
emaciated little girls in the shadow of Lord
Nelson. All the childish crowd was looking upward,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and every eye was completely round over
each widely-opened mouth, while paper-cap repeated
his formula. Poor children, looking at the
sky! Ah, Uniacke, what do you think of that
for a sermon?"</p>

<p>The young clergyman cleared his throat. The
red curtains by the narrow window blew outward
towards the fire, and sank in again, alternately
forcible and weak. The painter looked towards
the window and a sadness deepened in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Where is my wonder-child now?" he
said.</p>

<p>"You have lost sight of him?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;though the blood-money lies at my bank
and the paper-cap is in my studio."</p>

<p>"Is he not in London?"</p>

<p>"No, no; I learnt his history, the history of a
gamin of fifteen or thereabouts. It was much the
same as a history of a London pavement, with
this exception, that the gamin had a mother to
whom he presented me without undue formality.
The impression made upon me by that lady at
first was unfavourable, since she was slatternly,
drank, and was apparently given to cuffing and
kicking the boy&mdash;her only child. I considered her
an abandoned and unfeeling female. She dwelt
in Drury Lane and sold something that most of
us have never heard of."</p>

<p>"I can see her."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish to heaven I could not," the painter
said, with a sudden outburst of fire.</p>

<p>He was silent a moment and then continued:
"I had no difficulty in persuading her to let me
paint the boy. I don't think she rightly understood
what I meant, except that for some foolish
reason I was prepared to give her money, apparently
in return for nothing, that I meant to
have little Jack decently dressed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jack&mdash;was that his name?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and that he was to spend certain hours&mdash;snatched
from Trafalgar Square&mdash;in my house in
Kensington."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"The boy turned up in the jersey and cap and
boots I had bought him. And then his education
began. On first entering my studio he was numb
with surprise, a moving and speechless stare&mdash;more
overcome than by rainbows."</p>

<p>"Poor little chap!"</p>

<p>"I let him stray about examining everything.
He did so completely oblivious of my presence,
and of the fact that all the things in the place
were mine. By his demeanour one might have
supposed him engaged in an examination of
works of God never before brought to his notice.
While I smoked and pretended to read, he crept
about like a little animal, penetrating into corners
where statues stood, smelling&mdash;so it seemed&mdash;the
angles of painted walls, touching the petals of
flowers, smoothing rugs the wrong&mdash;but soon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
right&mdash;way. I can hear his new boots creaking
still. He was a very muscular little chap, but small.
When he was able to speak I questioned him.
He had never seen the sea. He had never been
out of London for a day or slept away from Drury
Lane for a night. The flask was empty; now to
pour the wine into it. I told him to sit down
by the open hearth. He obeyed, staring hard at
me before he sat, hard at the chair when he was
sitting. I interested him much less than old brocade
and lighted wax candles, which inspired him
with a solemnity that widened his eyes and narrowed
his features. He looked on a new, and
never-before-imagined, life. And he was grave to
excess, though, later, I found plenty of the London
child's impish nature in him."</p>

<p>"That impish quality hides in nearly all street-bred
children," said Uniacke. "I have seen larkiness
dawn in them for an instant at some recollection,
even when they were dying."</p>

<p>"I daresay. I can believe it. But Jack was solemn
at first, his brow thunderous with thought, as
he examined his chair and the rug under his new
boots. Then in the firelight I began my task. I
wrought to bring about in this Trafalgar Square
soul a sea change. For a time I did not attempt
to paint. I merely let the boy come to me day
by day, get accustomed to the studio, and listen to
my talk&mdash;which was often of the sea. I very soon
found that my intention had led me to the right
mind for my purpose; for the starved gaze that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
had been fixed on the rainbow could turn itself,
with equal wonder, similar rapture, on other things.
And the mind also could be brought to see what
was not visible to the eye. My studio&mdash;you must
see it some day&mdash;is full of recollections of sea days
and nights. Jack explored them. I eliminated
from the studio important objects of art which
might lead him to think of towns, of villages inland,
of wonderful foreign interiors. I fixed all
his nature upon this marvellous element which had
never murmured round his life before. I played to
him music in which the sea could be heard. I described
to him the onward gallop of the white
horses, racing over impenetrable depths. I painted
for him in words the varying colours of waves in
different seas, the black purple of tropical waters,
the bottle-green turmoil of a Cornish sea on a
choppy day, the brown channel waves near shore,
the jewelled smoothness of the Mediterranean in
early morning sunshine, its silver in moonrise,
melting into white and black. I told him of the
crowd of voices that cry in the sea, expressing all
the emotions which are uttered on land by the
voices of men; of the childish voices that may be
heard on August evenings in fiords, of the solemn
sobbing that fills an autumn night on the Northumbrian
coast, of the passionate roaring in mid
Atlantic, of the peculiar and frigid whisper of
waters struggling to break from the tightening
embrace of ice in extreme northern latitudes, of
the level moan of the lagoons. I explained to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
him how this element is so much alive that it is
never for a moment absolutely still, even when it
seems so to the eyes, as it sleeps within the
charmed embrace of a coral reef, extended, like
an arm, by some Pacific island far away. I drew
for him the thoughts of the sea, its intentions, its
desires, its regrets, its griefs, its savage and its quiet
joys. I narrated the lives in it, of fishes, of monsters;
its wonders of half human lives, too, the mermaids
who lie on the rocks at night to see the
twinkling lights on land, the mermen who swim
round them, wondering what those lights may
mean. I made him walk with me on the land
under the sea, where go the divers through the
wrecks, and ascend the rocky mountains and penetrate
the weedy valleys, and glide across the slippery,
oozy plains. In fine, Uniacke, I drowned
little Jack&mdash;I drowned him in the sea, I drowned
him in the sea."</p>

<p>The painter spoke the last words in a voice of
profound, even of morbid, melancholy, as if he
were indeed confessing a secret crime, driven by
some wayward and irresistible impulse. Uniacke
looked at him in growing surprise.</p>

<p>"And why not?" Uniacke asked.</p>

<p>But the painter did not reply. He continued:</p>

<p>"I made him see the rainbows of the sea and he
looked no more at the rainbows of the sky. For
at length I had his imagination fast in my net as
a salmon that fishermen entice within the stakes.
His town mind seemed to fade under my fostering,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and, Uniacke, 'nothing of him that did fade
but did suffer a sea change into something rich
and strange.'"</p>

<p>The painter got up from his chair and walked
over to the blowing wind that crept in at the
window fastenings. The red curtains flew out
towards him. He pushed them back with his
hands.</p>

<p>"Into something rich and strange," he repeated,
as if to himself. "And strange."</p>

<p>"Ah, but that was said, surely, of one who was
actually drowned in the sea," said the clergyman.
"It might be suitably placed on many of the memorial
slabs in the church yonder," he continued,
waving his hand towards the casement that looked
on the churchyard. "But your sea-urchin&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I speak only of the fading of the town
nature into the sea nature," rejoined the painter
quickly, "only of that. The soil of the childish
mind was enriched; his eyes shone as if touched
with a glow from the sun, swaying in the blue sea.
The Trafalgar Square gamin disappeared, and at
last my sea-urchin stood before me. As the little
Raleigh may have looked he looked at me, and I
saw in the face then rather the wonder of the sea
itself than the crude dancing desire of the little
adventurer who would sail it. And it was the
wonder of the sea embodied in a child that I desired
to paint, not the wakening of a human spirit
of gay seamanship and love of peril. That's for a
Christmas number&mdash;but that came at last."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>He stopped abruptly and faced the clergyman.</p>

<p>"Why does the second best succeed so often
and so closely the best, I wonder," he said. "It is
very often so in the art life of a man, even of a
great man. And it is so sometimes&mdash;perhaps you
know this better than I&mdash;in the soul life of a nature.
Must we always sink again after we have
soared? Must we do that? Is it an immutable
law?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps for a time. Surely, surely, not forever,"
said Uniacke.</p>

<p>His guest's conversation and personality began
to stir him more and more powerfully. It seemed
so new and vital an experience to be helped to
think, to have suggestion poured into him now,
after his many lonely island evenings.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, who can say?" said the painter. "I
had the best for a time&mdash;long enough for my immediate
purpose; for now I painted, and I felt
that I was enabled by little Jack to do fine work.
It seems he told his drinking mother in Drury
Lane, in his lingo, of the wonders of the sea. This
I learnt later. And, in his occasional, and now
somewhat fleeting visits to Trafalgar Square, he
explained to the emaciated little girls, in the
shadow of Nelson, the fact that there was to be
found, and seen, somewhere, water of a very different
kind from that splashing and churning in
the dingy basins guarded by the lions. Meanwhile
I painted little Jack, all the time keeping
alive in his nature the sea change, which was, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the end, to bring into my pocket &pound;1,000 in hard
cash."</p>

<p>Sir Graham said this with an indescribable cold
irony and bitterness.</p>

<p>"I can hear that money jingling in the wind,
upon my soul, Uniacke," he added, frowning
heavily.</p>

<p>The young clergyman was touched by a passing
thought of the painter's notorious ill-health.</p>

<p>"Before the picture was finished&mdash;quite completed&mdash;the
impish child began to waken in the
wonder-child, and I had to comply with the
demands of this new-born youngster. Our conversation&mdash;little
Jack's and mine&mdash;drifted from the
sea itself to the men and ships that travel it, to
the deeds of men that are done upon it; raidings
of Moorish pirates, expeditions to the Spanish
Main in old days, to the whaling grounds in new,
and so forth. When we got to this sort of thing
my work was nearly done and could not be spoiled.
So I let myself go, and talked several boys' books
in those afternoons. I was satisfied, damnably
satisfied&mdash;your pardon, Uniacke&mdash;with my work,
and I was heedless of all else. That is the cursed,
selfish instinct of the artist; that is the inadvertence
of which we spoke formerly. You remember?"</p>

<p>Uniacke nodded.</p>

<p>"My picture was before me and a child's budding
soul, and I thought of nothing at all but my
picture. That's sin, if you like. Little Jack, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
his jersey and squeaky boots, with his pale face
and great eyes, was my prey on canvas and my
&pound;1,000. I hugged myself and told him wild
stories of bold men on the sea. Uniacke, do you
believe in a personal devil?"</p>

<p>"I do," replied the young clergyman, simply.</p>

<p>"Well, if there is one, depend upon it he sometimes
requires an introduction before he can make
a soul's acquaintance. I effected the introduction
between him and my wonder-child when I sat in
the twilight and told Jack those tales of the sea.
The devil came to the boy in my studio, and I
opened the door and bowed him in. And once
he knew the boy, he stayed with him, Uniacke,
and whispered in his ear&mdash;'Desert your duty.
Life calls you. The sea calls you. Go to it.
Desert your duty!' Even a dirty little London
boy can have a duty and be aware of it, I suppose.
Eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I think that. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a moment. I've nearly finished my tale,
though I'm living the sequel to it at this moment.
One day I completed my picture; the last touch
was given. I stood back, I looked at my canvas.
I felt I had done well; my sea urchin was actually
what I had imagined. I had succeeded in that
curious effort&mdash;to accomplish which many of us
give our lives&mdash;in the effort to project perfectly
my thought, to give the exactly right form to my
imagination. I exulted. Yes, I had one grand
overwhelming moment of exultation. Then I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
turned from my completed picture. 'Jack,' I
cried out, 'little Jack, I've made you famous.
D'you know what that means?'</p>

<p>"I took the little chap by the shoulders and
placed him before the picture. 'See yourself,' I
added. The boy stared at the sea urchin, at those
painted eyes full of the sea wonder, at those parted
lips, that mouth whispering to the sea. His nose
twisted slightly.</p>

<p>"'That ain't me,' he said. 'That ain't me.'</p>

<p>"I looked down at him, and knew that he spoke
the truth; for already the wonder-child was fading,
even had faded. And a little adventurer, a
true boy, stood before me, a boy to pull ropes,
lend a hand at an oar, whistle in the rigging, gaze
with keen dancing eyes through a cold dawn to
catch the first sight of a distant land. I looked,
understood, didn't care; although the poetry of
wonder had faded into the prose of mere desire.</p>

<p>"'It isn't you, Jack?' I answered. 'Well, perhaps
not. But it is what you were, what you may
be again some day.'</p>

<p>"He shook his head.</p>

<p>"'No, it ain't me. Go on tellin' about them
pirits.'</p>

<p>"And, full of gladness, a glory I had never
known before, I went on till it was dark. I said
good-by to little Jack on the doorstep. When
he had gone, I stood for a moment listening to
the sound of his footsteps dying away down the
road. I did not know that I should never hear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
them again. For, although I did not want Jack
any more as a model, I was resolved not to lose
sight of him. To him I owed much. I would
pay my debt by making the child's future very
different from his past. I had vague thoughts of
educating him carefully for some reasonable life.
I believe, Uniacke, yes, on my soul, I believe that
I had bland visions of the sea-urchin being happy
and prosperous on a high stool in an office, at
home with ledgers, a contented little clerk, whose
horizon was bounded by an A B C shop, and
whose summer pastime was fly-killing. My big
work finished, a sort of eager idiocy seized me. I
was as a man drugged. My faculties must have
been besotted, I was in a dream. Three days afterwards
I woke from it and learnt that there may
be grandeur, yes, grandeur, dramatic in its force,
tragic in its height and depth, in a tipsy old woman
of Drury Lane."</p>

<p>"Jack's mother?"</p>

<p>The painter nodded. All the time he had been
talking the wind had steadily increased, and the
uproar of the embracing sea had been growing
louder. The windows rattled like musketry, the
red curtains shook as if in fear. Now there came
a knock at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," said the clergyman.</p>

<p>The maid appeared.</p>

<p>"Do you want anything more to-night, sir?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you, Kate. Good-night."</p>

<p>"Good-night, sir."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The door shut.</p>

<p>"Is it late?" said the painter.</p>

<p>"Nearly eleven. That is all."</p>

<p>"Are you tired, Uniacke? perhaps you are accustomed
to go to bed early?"</p>

<p>"Not very. Besides to-night the gale would
keep me awake; and I want to hear the end of
your story."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;Drury Lane invaded me one evening,
smelling of gin, with black bonnet cocked over
one eye, an impossible umbrella, broken boots,
straying hair, a mouth full of objurgation, and
oaths, and crying between times, 'Where's Jack?
Where's my boy? What 'a yer done with my
boy,&mdash;yer!' I received Drury Lane with astonishment
but, I hope, with courtesy, and explained
that my picture was finished, that Jack had left me
to go home, that I meant to take care of his future.</p>

<p>"My remarks were received with oaths, and the
repeated demand to know where Jack was. 'Isn't
he at home?' I asked. 'No, nor he ain't been
'ome.' After a while I gathered that Jack had
disappeared in darkness from my house on the
night when I put the last touch to my picture,
and had not been seen by his mother since. She
now began to soften and to cry, and I observed
that maternity was in her as well as cheap gin. I
endeavoured to comfort her and promised that
little Jack should be found.</p>

<p>"'If he ain't found,' she sobbed, 'I'm done for,
I am; 'e's my hall.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"There was something horribly genuine in the
sound of this cry. I began to see beyond the gin
in which this poor woman was soaked; I began
to see her half-drowned soul that yet had life, had
breath.</p>

<p>"'We'll find him,' I said.</p>

<p>"'Never, never,' she wailed, rocking her thin
body to and fro, 'I know 'e's gone to sea, 'e 'as.
Jack's run away fur a sailor.'</p>

<p>"At these words I turned cold, for I felt as if
they were true. I saw in a flash the result of my
experiment. I had shown the boy the way that
led to the great sea. Perhaps that night, even as
he left my door, he had seen in fancy the white
waves playing before him in the distance, the ships
go sailing by. He had heard siren voices calling
his youth and he had heeded them. His old mother
kept on cursing me at intervals. Instinct, rather
than actual knowledge, led her to attribute this
disappearance to my initiative. I did not attempt
to reason her out of the belief, for alas! I began
to hold it myself, Uniacke."</p>

<p>"You thought Jack had run away to sea,
prompted by all that you had told him of the
sea?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And I think it still."</p>

<p>"Think&mdash;then you don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't know it, you'd say? Do I not? Uniacke,
a little while ago, when you told me of that&mdash;that
woman for whom you cared much, you remember
my saying to you, was there not something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
within you that would tell you if she were
dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember."</p>

<p>"That something which makes a man know a
thing without what is generally called knowledge
of it. Well, that something within me makes me
know that little Jack did run away to sea. I
searched for him, I strove, as far as one can do
such a thing, to sift all the innumerable grains of
London through my fingers to find that one little
grain I wanted. I spared no pains in my search.
Conceive, even, that I escorted Drury Lane in the
black bonnet to the Docks, to ships lying in the
Thames, to a thousand places! It was all in
vain; the wonder-child was swallowed up. I had
indeed drowned little Jack in the sea. I have never
set eyes on him since he left me on the evening of
the day when I completed my picture. Shall I
ever set eyes on him again? Shall I, Uniacke?
Shall I?"</p>

<p>Sir Graham put this strange question with a
sort of morose fierceness, getting up from his chair
as he spoke. The young clergyman could think
of no reply.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he said at last. "He may be
well, happy, active in a life that he loves, that he
glories in."</p>

<p>"No, Uniacke, no, for he's far away from his
duty. That hideous old woman, in her degradation,
in her cruelty, in her drunkenness, loved that
boy, loves him still, with an intensity, a passion, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
hunger, a feverish anxiety that are noble, that are
great. Her hatred of me proves it. I honour her
for her hatred. I respect her for it! She shows
the beauty of her soul in her curses. She almost
teaches me that there is indeed immortality&mdash;at
least for women&mdash;by her sleepless horror of me.
Her hatred, I say, is glorious, because her love
shines through it. I feed her. She doesn't know
it. She'd starve rather than eat my bread. She
would kill me, I believe, if she didn't fancy in her
vague mind, obscured by drink, that the man who
had sent her boy from her might bring him back
to her. For weeks she came every day&mdash;walking
all the way from Drury Lane, mind you&mdash;to ask
if the boy had returned. Then she endured the
nightmare of my company, as I told you, while we
searched in likely places for the vanished sea
urchin. Jack did nothing for the support of his
mother. It was she who kept him. She beat
him. She cursed him. She fed him. She loved
him; like an animal, perhaps, like a mother, certainly.
That says all, Uniacke. It was I who
sent that boy away. I must give him back to that
old woman. Till I do so I can never find peace.
This thing preys upon my life, eats into my heart.
It's the little worm gnawing, always gnawing at
me. The doctors tell me I am morbid because I
am in bad health, that my bad health makes the
malady in my mind. On the contrary, it is my
mind that makes the malady in my body. Ah!
you are wondering! You are wondering, too,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
whether it's not the other way! I see you
are!"</p>

<p>"I cannot deny it," Uniacke said gently.</p>

<p>"You are wrong. You are wrong, I assure you.
And surely you, a clergyman, ought to be the
very man to understand me, to know how what
seems a slight thing, a small selfishness, well, the
inadvertence we spoke of lately, may punish the
soul, may have a long and evil train of consequences.
I was careless of that child, careful only
of my ambition. I ground the child in the mortar
of my ambition; is it not natural that I should
suffer now? Does not your religion tell you that
it is right? Answer me that?"</p>

<p>Uniacke hesitated. A conviction had been
growing up in him all the evening that his guest
was suffering severely under some nervous affliction;
one of those obscure diseases which change
the whole colour of life to the sufferer, which distort
all actions however simple and ordinary, which
render diminutive trials monstrous, and small
evils immense and ineffably tragic. It seemed to
Uniacke to be his duty to combat Sir Graham's
increasing melancholy, which actually bordered
upon despair. At the same time, the young
clergyman could not hide from his mind&mdash;a mind
flooded with conscience&mdash;that the painter was
slightly to blame for the action which had been
followed by so strange a result.</p>

<p>"I see you hesitate, Uniacke," said Sir Graham.
"Ah, you agree with me!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; I think you may have been careless.
But you magnify a slight error into a grievous
sin; and I do indeed believe that it must be your
present bad state of health which acts as the magnifying
glass. That is my honest opinion."</p>

<p>"No, no," said the painter, almost with anger,
"my illness is all from the mind. If I could find
that boy, if I could give him back to his mother,
I should recover my peace, I should recover my
health&mdash;I should no longer be haunted, driven as
I am now. But, Uniacke, do you know what it
is that I fear most of all, what it is that dogs me,
night and day; though I strive to put it from
me, to tell myself that it is a chimera?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"The belief that little Jack is dead; that he has
been drowned at sea, perhaps lately, perhaps long
ago."</p>

<p>"Why should you think that? You do not
even know for certain that he ran away to sea."</p>

<p>"I am sure of it. If he is dead! If he is dead!"</p>

<p>The painter, as if in an access of grief, turned
abruptly from the fire, walked over to the window,
pulled one of the blowing curtains aside and approached
his face to the glass.</p>

<p>"In spite of the storm it is still so light that I
can see those graves," he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Don't look at them, Sir Graham. Let us talk
of other things."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and&mdash;yes, Uniacke, that poor, mad Skipper
is still out there, lingering among them. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
is by the churchyard wall, where you were standing
this evening in the twilight: one would say he
was watching."</p>

<p>The clergyman had also risen from his seat.
He moved a step or two across the little room, then
stood still, looking at Sir Graham, who was half
concealed by the fluttering curtains.</p>

<p>"He is just where I stood?" Uniacke asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then he is watching."</p>

<p>"By a grave?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Only one of his crew ever gained the
land. He gained it&mdash;a corpse. He is buried by
that wall. I was reading the inscription upon his
tombstone, and wondering&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wondering? Yes?"</p>

<p>"Where he is, how he is now, far away from the
voice of the sea which took his life, the wind
which roared his requiem."</p>

<p>"Poor man! You were here when he was
washed up on the beach?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I buried him. The Skipper&mdash;sane then,
though in terrible grief&mdash;was able to identify him,
to follow the drowned body as chief mourner, to
choose the inscription for the stone."</p>

<p>"What was it?" asked Sir Graham, without
curiosity, idly, almost absently.</p>

<p>"'Lead, kindly light.' He would have that put.
I think he had heard the boy sing it, or whistle the
tune of it, at sea one day."</p>

<p>"The boy? It was a boy then?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The clergyman spoke with a certain hesitation,
a sudden diffidence. He looked at the painter,
and an abrupt awkwardness, almost a shamefacedness,
crept into his manner, even showed itself in
his attitude. The painter did not seem to be
aware of it. He was still engrossed in his own
sorrow, his own morbid reflections. He looked
out again in the night.</p>

<p>"Poor faithful watch-dog," he murmured.</p>

<p>Then he turned away from the window.</p>

<p>"The Skipper does not wait for that boy," he
said. "He knows at least that he can never come
to him from the sea."</p>

<p>"Strangely&mdash;no. Indeed, he always looks for
the boy first."</p>

<p>"First, do you say? Was it so to-night?"</p>

<p>Again Uniacke hesitated. He was on the verge
of telling a lie, but conscience intervened.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said.</p>

<p>"Didn't he speak of little Jack?" said Sir Graham
slowly, and with a sudden nervous spasm
of the face.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir Graham."</p>

<p>"That's curious."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"The same name&mdash;my wonder-child's name."</p>

<p>"And the name of a thousand children."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course. And&mdash;and, Uniacke, the
other name, the other name upon that tomb?"</p>

<p>"What other name?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why the surname. What is that?"</p>

<p>The painter was standing close to the clergyman
and staring straight into his eyes. For a moment
Uniacke made no reply. Then he answered
slowly:</p>

<p>"There is no other name."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;the&mdash;the Skipper would only have Jack
put, that was all. Jack&mdash;he was the boy on the
schooner 'Flying Fish'&mdash;'Lead, kindly light.'"</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>The exclamation came in a sigh, that might
have been a murmur of relief or of disappointment.
Then there was a silence. The painter went over
again to the fire. Uniacke stood still where he
was and looked on the ground. He had told a deliberate
lie. It seemed to grow as he thought of it.
And why had he told it? A sudden impulse, a
sudden fear, had led him into sin. A strange fancy
had whispered to him, "What if that boy buried
by the wall yonder should be the wonder-child,
the ragamuffin who looked at the rainbow, the sea
urchin, the spectre haunting your guest?" How
unlikely that was! And yet ships go far, and the
human fate is often mysteriously sad. It might be
that the wonder-child was born to be wrecked, to
be cast up, streaming with sea-water on the strand
of this lonely isle. It might be that the eyes
which worshipped the rainbow were sightless beneath
that stone yonder; that the hands which
pointed to it were folded in the eternal sleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
And, if so, was not the lie justified? If so, could
Peter Uniacke regret it? He saw this man who
had come into his lonely life treading along the
verge of a world that made him tremble in horror.
Dared he lead him across the verge into the darkness?
And yet his lie troubled him, and he saw a
stain spreading slowly out upon the whiteness of
his ardent soul. The painter turned from the fire.
His face was haggard and weary.</p>

<p>"I will go to bed," he said. "I must try to get
some sleep even in the storm."</p>

<p>He held out his thin hand. Uniacke took it.</p>

<p>"Good-night," he said.</p>

<p>"Good-night. I am sorry I have troubled you
with my foolish history."</p>

<p>"It interested me deeply. By the way&mdash;what
did you say your wonder-child's name was, his
full name?"</p>

<p>"Jack&mdash;Jack Pringle. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. That gust of wind startled me.
Good-night."</p>

<p>The painter looked at Uniacke narrowly, then
left the room.</p>

<p>The clergyman went over to the fire, leaned his
arms on the mantelpiece, and rested his head on
them.</p>

<p>Presently he lifted his head, went softly to the
door, opened it and listened. He heard the tread
of his guest above stairs, moving to and fro about
the spare room. He waited. After a while there
was silence in the house. Only the wind and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
sea roared outside. Then Uniacke went into the
kitchen, pulled out a drawer in a dresser that stood
by the window, and took from it a chisel and a
hammer. He carried them into the passage, furtively
put on his coat and hat, and, with all the
precaution of a thief, unlocked the front door and
stole out into the storm.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<h3>PART II.<br />
THE GRAVE.</h3>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<h3>PART II.<br />
THE GRAVE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the morning the storm was still fierce.
Clouds streamed across a sky that bent lower and
lower towards the aspiring sea blanched with foam.
There was little light, and the Rectory parlour
looked grim and wintry when Sir Graham and
Uniacke met there at breakfast time. The clergyman
was pale and seemed strangely discomforted
and at first unable to be natural. He greeted his
guest with a forcible, and yet flickering, note of
cheerfulness, abrupt and unsympathetic, as he
sat down behind the steaming coffee-pot. The
painter scarcely responded. He was still attentive
to the storm. He ate very little.</p>

<p>"You slept?" asked Uniacke presently.</p>

<p>"Only for a short time towards dawn. I sat at
my window most of the night."</p>

<p>"At your window?" Uniacke said uneasily.</p>

<p>"Yes. Somebody&mdash;a man&mdash;I suppose it must
have been the Skipper&mdash;came out from the shadow
of this house soon after I went to my bedroom,
and stole to that grave by the churchyard wall."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Really," said Uniacke. "Did he stay there?"</p>

<p>"For some time, bending down. It seemed to
me as if he were at some work, some task&mdash;or perhaps
he was only praying in his mad way, poor
fellow!"</p>

<p>"Praying&mdash;yes, yes, very likely. A little more
coffee?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you. The odd thing was that after
a while he ceased and returned to this house. One
might have thought it was his home."</p>

<p>"You could not see if it was the Skipper?"</p>

<p>"No, the figure was too vague in the faint
stormy light. But it must have been he. Who
else would be out at such a time in such a
night?"</p>

<p>"He never heeds the weather," said Uniacke.</p>

<p>His pale face had suddenly flushed scarlet, and
he felt a pricking as of needles in his body. It
seemed to him that he was transparent like a thing
of glass, and that his guest must be able to see
not merely the trouble of his soul, but the fact
that was its cause. And the painter did now begin
to observe his host's unusual agitation.</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;your night?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I did not sleep at all," said Uniacke quickly,
telling the truth with a childish sense of relief, "I
was excited."</p>

<p>"Excited!" said Sir Graham.</p>

<p>"The unwonted exercise of conversation. You
forget that I am generally a lonely man," said the
clergyman, once more drawn into the sin of subterfuge,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and scorching in it almost like a soul in
hell.</p>

<p>He got up from the breakfast-table, feeling
strangely unhappy and weighed down with guilt.
Yet, as he looked at the painter's worn face and
hollow eyes, his heart murmured, perhaps deceitfully,
"You are justified."</p>

<p>"I must go out. I must go into the village,"
he said.</p>

<p>"In this weather?"</p>

<p>"We islanders think nothing of it. We pursue
our business though the heavens crack and the sea
touches the clouds."</p>

<p>He went out hurriedly and with the air of a man
painfully abashed. Once beyond the churchyard,
in the plough-land of the island road, he continued
his tormented reverie of the night. Never
before had he done evil that good might come.
He had never supposed that good could come
out of evil, but had deemed the supposition
a monstrous and a deadly fallacy, to be combated,
to be struck down to the dust. Even
now he was chiefly conscious of a mental weakness
in himself which had caused him to act
as he had acted. He saw himself as one of those
puny creatures whose so-called kind hearts lead
them into follies, into crimes. Like many young
men of virtuous life and ascetic habit, Uniacke
was disposed to worship that which was uncompromising
in human nature, the slight hardness
which sometimes lurks, like a kernel, in the saint.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
But he was emotional. He was full of pity. He
desired to bandage the wounded world, to hush
its cries of pain, to rock it to rest, even though he
believed that suffering was its desert. And to the
individual, more especially, he was very tender.
Like a foolish woman, perhaps, he told himself
to-day as he walked on heavily in the wild wind,
debating his deed of the night and its consequences.</p>

<p>He had erased the name of Pringle from the
stone that covered little Jack, the wonder-child.
And he felt like a criminal. Yet he dreaded the
sequel of a discovery by the painter, that his fears
were well founded, that his sea urchin had indeed
been claimed by the hunger of the sea. Uniacke
had worked in cities and had seen much of sad
men. He had learnt to read them truly for the
most part, and to foresee clearly in many instances
the end of their journeys. And his ministrations
had taught him to comprehend the tragedies that
arise from the terrible intimacy which exists between
the body and its occupant the soul. He
could not tell, as a doctor might have been able
to tell, whether the morbid condition into which
Sir Graham had come was primarily due to ill-health
of the mind acting upon the body or the
reverse. But he felt nearly sure that if the painter's
fears were proved suddenly to him to be well
founded, he might not improbably fall into a condition
of permanent melancholia, or even of active
despair. Despite his apparent hopelessness, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
was at present sustained by ignorance of the fate
of little Jack. He did not actually know him
dead. The knowledge would knock a prop from
under him. He would fall into some dreadful
abyss. The young clergyman's deceit alone held
him back. But it might be discovered at any
moment. One of the islanders might chance to
observe the defacement of the tomb. A gossiping
woman might mention to Sir Graham the
name that had vanished. Yet these chances were
remote. A drowned stranger boy is naught to
such folk as these, bred up in familiarity with violent
death. Long ago they had ceased to talk of
the schooner "Flying Fish," despite the presence
of the mad Skipper, despite the sound of church
bells in the night. Fresh joys, or tragedies,
absorbed them. For even the island world has
its record. Time plants his footsteps upon the
loneliest land. And the dwellers note his onward
tour.</p>

<p>Uniacke reckoned the chances for and against
the discovery of his furtive act of mercy and its
revelation to his guest. The latter outnumbered
the former. Yet Uniacke walked nervously as
one on the verge of disaster. In the Island cottages
that morning he bore himself uneasily in the
presence of his simple-minded parishioners. Sitting
beside an invalid, whose transparent mind
was dimly, but with ardent faith, set on Heaven,
he felt hideously unfitted to point the way to that
place into which no liar shall ever come. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
troubled, and prayed at random for the dying&mdash;thinking
of the dead. At the same time he felt
himself the chief of sinners and knew that there
was a devil in him capable of repeating his nocturnal
act. Never before had he gathered so vital
a knowledge of the complexity of man. He
saw the threads of him all ravelled up. When he
finished his prayers at the bedside, the invalid
watched him with the critical amazement of illness.</p>

<p>He went out trembling and conscience-stricken.
When he reached the churchyard on his way
homewards, he saw Sir Graham moving among
the graves. He had apparently just come out
from the Rectory and was making his way to the
low stone wall, over which shreds of foam were
being blown by the wind. Uniacke hastened his
steps, and hailed Sir Graham in a loud and harsh
voice. He paused, and shading his eyes with his
arched hands, gazed towards the road.</p>

<p>Uniacke hurried through the narrow gate and
joined his guest, who looked like a man startled
out of some heavy reverie.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is you," he said. "Well, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You were going to watch the sea, I know. It
is worth watching to-day. Come with me. I'll
take you to the point&mdash;to the nigger."</p>

<p>"The nigger?"</p>

<p>"The fishermen call the great black rock at the
north end of the Island by that name. The sea
must be breaking magnificently."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Uniacke took Sir Graham's arm and led him
away, compelling him almost as if he were a child.
They left the churchyard behind them, and were
soon in solitary country alone with the roar of
wind and sea. Branching presently from the road
they came into a narrow, scarcely perceptible, track,
winding downward over short grass drenched
with moisture. The dull sheep scattered slowly
from them on either side of the way. Presently
the grass ceased at the edge of an immense
blunt rock, like a disfigured head, that contemplated
fixedly the white turmoil of the sea.</p>

<p>"A place for shipwreck," said Sir Graham. "A
place of death."</p>

<p>Uniacke nodded. The painter swept an arm
towards the sea.</p>

<p>"What a graveyard! One would say the time
had come for it to give up its dead and it was
passionately fighting against the immutable decree.
Is Jack somewhere out there?"</p>

<p>He turned and fixed his eyes upon Uniacke's
face. Uniacke's eyes fell.</p>

<p>"Is he?" repeated Sir Graham.</p>

<p>"How can I tell?" exclaimed Uniacke, almost
with a sudden anger. "Let us go back."</p>

<p>Towards evening the storm suddenly abated.
A pale yellow light broke along the horizon,
almost as the primroses break out along the
horizon of winter. The thin black spars of
a hurrying vessel pointed to the illumination
and vanished, leaving the memory of a tortured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
gesture from some sea-thing. And as the
yellow deepened to gold, the Skipper set the
church bells ringing. Sir Graham opened the
parlour window wide and listened, leaning out
towards the graves. Uniacke was behind him in
the room. Vapour streamed up from the buffeted
earth, which seemed panting for a repose it
had no strength to gain. Ding dong! Ding
dong! The wild and far-away light grew to
flame and faded to darkness. In the darkness the
bells seemed clearer, for light deafens the imagination.
Uniacke felt a strange irritability coming
upon him. He moved uneasily in his chair,
watching the motionless, stretched figure of his
guest. Presently he said:</p>

<p>"Sir Graham!"</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>"Sir Graham!"</p>

<p>He got up, crossed the little room and touched
the shoulder of the dreamer. Sir Graham started
sharply and turned a frowning face.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"The atmosphere is very cold and damp after
the storm."</p>

<p>"You wish me to shut the window? I beg
your pardon."</p>

<p>He drew in and shut it, then moved to the
door.</p>

<p>"You are going out?" said Uniacke uneasily.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I would not speak to the Skipper, if I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
were you. He is happier when he is let quite
alone."</p>

<p>"I want to see him. I want him to sit for me."</p>

<p>"To sit!" Uniacke repeated, with an accent
almost of horror.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sir Graham doggedly. "I have a
great picture in my mind."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Skipper's meeting with his drowned comrades,
in that belfry tower. He will stand with
the ropes dropping from his hands, triumph in his
eyes. They will be seen coming up out of the
darkness, grey men and dripping from the sea,
with dead eyes and hanging lips. And first
among them will be my wonder-child, on whom
will fall a ray of light from a wild moon, half
seen through the narrow slit of the deep-set window."</p>

<p>"No, no!"</p>

<p>"What do you say?"</p>

<p>"Your wonder-child must not be there. Why
should he? He is alive."</p>

<p>"You think so?"</p>

<p>Uniacke made no reply.</p>

<p>"I say, do you think so?"</p>

<p>"How can I know? It is impossible. But&mdash;yes,
I think so."</p>

<p>The clergyman turned away. A sickness of the
conscience overtook him like physical pain. Sir
Graham was by the door with his hand upon it.</p>

<p>"And yet," he said, "you do not believe in intuitions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Nothing tells you whether that woman
you loved is dead or living. You said that."</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Then what should tell you whether Jack is
dead or living?"</p>

<p>He turned and went out. Presently Uniacke
saw his dark figure pass, like a shadow, across the
square of the window. The night grew more
quiet by slow degrees. The hush after the storm
increased. And to the young clergyman's unquiet
nerves it seemed like a crescendo in music instead
of like a diminuendo, as sometimes seems the falling
to sleep of a man to a man who cannot sleep.
The noise of the storm had been softer than the
sound of this increasing silence in which the church
bells presently died away. Uniacke was consumed
by an apprehension that was almost like
the keen tooth of jealousy. For he knew that the
Skipper had ceased from his patient task and Sir
Graham did not return. He imagined a colloquy.
But the Skipper's madness would preserve the
secret which he no longer knew, and, therefore,
could not reveal. He made the bells call Jack
Pringle. He would never point to the defaced
grave and say, "Jack Pringle lies beneath this
stone." And yet sanity might, perhaps, return, a
rush of knowledge of the past and recognition of
its tragedy.</p>

<p>Uniacke took his hat and went to the door. He
stood out on the step. Sea-birds were crying.
The sound of the sea withdrew moment by moment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
as if it were stealing furtively away. Behind,
in the rectory passage, the servant clattered
as she brought in the supper.</p>

<p>"Sir Graham!" Uniacke called suddenly. "Sir
Graham!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The voice came from somewhere in the shadow
of the church.</p>

<p>"Will you not come in? Supper is ready."</p>

<p>In a moment the painter came out of the gloom.</p>

<p>"That churchyard draws me," he said, mounting
the step.</p>

<p>"You saw the Skipper?"</p>

<p>"Yes, leaving."</p>

<p>"Did he speak to you?"</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>The clergyman breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>In the evening Uniacke turned his pipe two or
three times in his fingers and said, looking down:</p>

<p>"That picture of yours&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. What of it?"</p>

<p>"You will paint it in London, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"How can I do that? The imagination of it
came to me here, is sustained and quickened by
these surroundings."</p>

<p>"You mean to paint it here?" the clergyman
faltered.</p>

<p>Sir Graham was evidently struck by his host's
air of painful discomfiture.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said hastily. "Of
course I do not mean to inflict myself upon your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
kind hospitality while I am working. I shall return
to the inn."</p>

<p>Uniacke flushed red at being so misunderstood.</p>

<p>"I cannot let you do that. No, no! Honestly,
my question was only prompted by&mdash;by&mdash;a
thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Do not think me impertinent. But, really, a
regard for you has grown up in me since you have
allowed me to know you&mdash;a great regard indeed."</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you, Uniacke," said the
painter, obviously moved.</p>

<p>"And it has struck me that in your present
condition of health, and seeing that your mind is
pursued by these&mdash;these melancholy sea thoughts
and imaginings, it might be safer, better for you
to be in a place less desolate, less preyed upon by
the sea. That is all. Believe me, that is all."</p>

<p>He spoke the last words with the peculiar insistence
and almost declamatory fervour of the liar.
But he was now embarked upon deceit and must
crowd all sail. And with the utterance of his lie
he took an abrupt resolution.</p>

<p>"Let us go away together somewhere," he exclaimed,
with a brightening face. "I need a holiday.
I will get a brother clergyman to come over
from the mainland and take my services. You
asked me some day to return your visit. I accept
your invitation here and now. Let me come with
you to London."</p>

<p>Sir Graham shook his head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"You put me in the position of an inhospitable
man," he said. "In the future you must come to
me. I look forward to that. I depend upon it.
But I cannot go to London at present. My house,
my studio are become loathsome to me. The very
street in which I live echoes with childish footsteps.
I cannot be there."</p>

<p>"Sir Graham, you must learn to look upon your
past act in a different light. If you do not, your
power of usefulness in the world will be crushed."</p>

<p>The clergyman spoke with an intense earnestness.
His sense of his own increasing unworthiness,
the fighting sense of the necessity laid
upon him to be unworthy for this sick man's sake,
tormented him, set his heart in a sea of trouble.
He strove to escape out of it by mental exertion.
His eyes shone with unnatural fervour as he went
on:</p>

<p>"When you first told me your story, I thought
this thing weighed upon you unnecessarily. Now
I see more and more clearly that your unnatural
misery over a very natural act springs from ill-health.
It is your body which you confuse with
your conscience. Your remorse is a disease removable
by medicine, by a particular kind of air
or scene, by waters even it may be, or by hard exercise,
or by a voyage."</p>

<p>"A voyage!" cried Sir Graham bitterly.</p>

<p>"Well, well&mdash;by such means, I would say, as
come to a doctor's mind. You labour under the
yoke of the body."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you think that whenever your conscience
says, 'You have done wrong'? Tell me!"</p>

<p>Uniacke, who had got up in his excitement,
recoiled at these words which struck him hard.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I!" he almost stammered. "What have
I got to do with it?"</p>

<p>"I ask you to judge yourself, to put yourself in
my place. That is all. Do you tell me that all
workings of conscience are due to obscure bodily
causes?"</p>

<p>"How could I? No, but yours&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are not. They hurt my body. They do not
come from my body's hurt. And they increase
upon me in this place, yes, they increase upon me."</p>

<p>"I knew it," cried Uniacke.</p>

<p>"Why is that?" said Sir Graham, with a melancholy
accent. "I feel, I begin to feel that there
must be some powerful reason&mdash;yes, in this island."</p>

<p>"There cannot be. Leave it! Leave it!"</p>

<p>"I am held here."</p>

<p>"By what?"</p>

<p>"Something intangible, invisible&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing, then."</p>

<p>"All-powerful. I cannot go. If I would go, I
cannot. Perhaps&mdash;perhaps Jack is coming here."</p>

<p>The painter's eyes were blazing. Uniacke felt
himself turn cold.</p>

<p>"Jack coming here!" he said harshly. "Nonsense,
Sir Graham. Nobody ever comes here."</p>

<p>"Dead bodies come on the breast of the
sea."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>The painter looked towards the window, putting
himself into an attitude of horrible expectation.</p>

<p>"Is it not so?" he asked, in a voice that quivered
slightly as if with an agitation he was trying to
suppress.</p>

<p>Uniacke made no reply. He was seized with a
horror he had not known before. He recognised
that the island influence mysteriously held his
guest. After an interval he said abruptly:</p>

<p>"What is your doctor's name, did you say?"</p>

<p>"Did I ever say whom I had consulted?" said
Sir Graham, almost with an invalid's ready suspicion,
and peering at the clergyman under his thick
eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Surely. But I forget things so easily," said
Uniacke calmly.</p>

<p>"Braybrooke is the man&mdash;Cavendish Square.
An interesting fellow. You may have heard of
his book on the use of colour as a sort of physic in
certain forms of illness."</p>

<p>"I have. What sort of man is he?"</p>

<p>"Very small, very grey, very indecisive in manner."</p>

<p>"Indecisive?"</p>

<p>"In manner. In reality a man of infinite conviction."</p>

<p>"May I ask if you told him your story?"</p>

<p>"The story of my body&mdash;naturally. One goes
to a doctor to do that."</p>

<p>"And did that narrative satisfy him?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. Not a bit."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well&mdash;and so?"</p>

<p>"I did not tell him my mental story. I explained
to him that I suffered greatly from melancholy.
That was all. I called it unreasoning melancholy.
Why not? I knew he could do no more
than put my body a little straight. He did his
best."</p>

<p>"I see," said Uniacke, slowly.</p>

<p>That night, after Sir Graham had gone to bed,
Uniacke came to a resolution. He decided to
write to Doctor Braybrooke, betray, for his guest's
sake, his guest's confidence, and ask the great man's
advice in the matter, revealing to him the strange
fact that fate had led the painter of the sea urchin
to the very edge of the grave in which he slept so
quietly. No longer did Uniacke hesitate, or pause
to ask himself why he permitted the sorrow of a
stranger thus to control, to upset, his life. And,
indeed, is the man who tells us his sorrow a
stranger to us? Uniacke's creed taught him to
be unselfish, taught him to concern himself in the
afflictions of others. Already he had sinned, he
had lied for this stricken man. He, a clergyman,
had gone out in the night and had defaced a grave.
All this lay heavy on his heart. His conscience
smote him. And yet, when he saw before him
in the night the vision of this tortured man, he
knew that he would repeat his sin if necessary.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday. He sat down and
tried to think of the two sermons he had to preach.
The sea lay very still on the Sabbath morning, still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
under a smooth and pathetic grey sky. The atmosphere
seemed that of a winter fairyland. All
the sea-birds were in hiding. Small waves licked
the land like furtive tongues seeking some dainty
food with sly desire. Across the short sea-grass
the island children wound from school to church,
and the island lads gathered in knots to say nothing.
The whistling of a naughty fisherman attending
to his nets unsabbatically pierced the still
and magically cruel air with a painful sharpness.
People walked in silence without knowing why they
did not care to speak. And even the girls, discreet
in ribbons and shining boots, thought less of kisses
than they generally did on Sunday. The older
people, sober by temperament, became sombre
under the influence of sad, breathless sky, and
breathless waters. The coldness that lay in the
bosom of nature soon found its way to the responsive
bosom of humanity. It chilled Uniacke
in the pulpit, Sir Graham in the pew below. The
one preached without heart. The other listened
without emotion. All this was in the morning.
But at evening nature stirred in her repose and
turned, with the abruptness of a born coquette, to
pageantry. A light wind got up. The waves were
curved and threw up thin showers of ivory spray
playfully along the rocks. The sense of fairyland,
wrapped in ethereal silences, quivered and broke
like disturbed water. And the grey womb of the
sky swelled in the west to give up a sunset that
became tragic in its crescendo of glory. Bursting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
forth in flame&mdash;a narrow line of fire along the sea&mdash;it
pushed its way slowly up the sky. Against
the tattered clouds a hidden host thrust forth
their spears of gold. And a wild-rose colour descended
upon the gentle sea and floated to the
island, bathing the rocks, the grim and weather-beaten
houses, the stones of the churchyard, with a
radiance so delicate, and yet so elfish, that enchantment
walked there till the night came down, and in
the darkness the islanders moved on their way to
church. The pageant was over. But it had stirred
two imaginations. It blazed yet in two hearts.
The shock of its coming, after long hours of storm,
had stirred Uniacke and his guest strangely. And
the former, leaving in the rectory parlour the sermon
he had composed, preached extempore on
the text, "In the evening there shall be light."</p>

<p>He began radiantly and with fervour. But some
spirit of contradiction entered his soul as he spoke,
impelling him to a more sombre mood that was
yet never cold, but rather impassioned full of
imaginative despair. He was driven on to discourse
of the men who will not see light, of the
men who draw thick blinds to shut out light. And
then he was led, by the egoism that so subtly
guides even the best among men, to speak of
those fools who, by fostering darkness, think to
compel sunshine, as a man may mix dangerous
chemicals in a laboratory, seeking to advance some
cause of science and die in the poisonous fumes
of his own devilish brew. Can good, impulsive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and radiant, come out of deliberate evil? Must
not a man care first for his own soul if he would
heal the soul of even one other? Uniacke spoke
with a strange and powerful despair on this subject.
He ended in a profound sadness and with the
words of one scourged by doubts.</p>

<p>There was a pause, the shuffle of moving feet.
Then the voice of the clerk announced the closing
hymn. It was "Lead, Kindly Light," chosen by
the harmonium player and submitted to Uniacke,
who, however, had failed to notice that it was
included in the list of hymns for the day. The
clerk's voice struck on him like a blow. He stared
down from the pulpit and met the upward gaze of
his guest. Then he laid his cold hands on the
wooden ledge of the pulpit and turned away his
eyes. For he felt as if Sir Graham must understand
the secret that lay in them. The islanders
sang the hymn lustily, bending their heads over
their books beneath the dull oil lamps that filled
the church with a dingy yellow twilight. Alone,
at the back of the building, the mad Skipper stood
up by the belfry door and stared straight before
him as if he watched. And Uniacke's trouble
increased, seeming to walk in the familiar music
which had been whistled by Jack Pringle as he
swarmed to the mast-head, or turned into his bunk
at night far out at sea. Sir Graham had spoken
of intuitions. Surely, the clergyman thought,
to-night he will feel the truth and my lie. To-night
he will understand that it is useless to wait, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the wonder-child can never come to this island,
for he came on the breast of the sea long
ago. And if he does know, now, at this moment,
while the islanders are singing,</p>

<div class="center"><small>"And with the morn those angel faces smile&mdash;"</small></div>

<p class="noin">how will he regard me, who have lied to him and
who have preached to him, coward and hypocrite?
For still the egoism was in Uniacke's heart.
There is no greater egoist than the good man who
has sinned against his nature. He sits down eternally
to contemplate his own soul. When the
hymn was over Uniacke mechanically gave the
blessing and knelt down. But he did not pray.
His mind stood quite still all the time he was on
his knees. He got up wearily, and as he made
his way into the little vestry, he fancied that he
heard behind him a sound as of some one tramping
in sea-boots upon the rough church pavement.
He looked round and saw the bland face of the
clerk, who wore perpetually a little smile, like that
of a successful public entertainer. That evening
he wrote to Doctor Braybrooke.</p>

<p>On the morrow Sir Graham began the first
sketch for his picture, "<i>The Procession of the
Drowned to their faithful Captain</i>."</p>

<p>Three mornings later, when Uniacke came to
the breakfast-table, Sir Graham, who was down
before him, handed to him a letter, the envelope
of which was half torn open.</p>

<p>"It was put among mine," he said in apology,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
"and as the handwriting was perfectly familiar to
me, I began to open it."</p>

<p>"Familiar?" said Uniacke, taking the letter.</p>

<p>"Yes. It bears an exact resemblance to Doctor
Braybrooke's writing."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Uniacke, laying the letter aside
rather hastily.</p>

<p>They sat down on either side of the table.</p>

<p>"You don't read your letter," Sir Graham said,
after two or three minutes had passed.</p>

<p>"After breakfast. I don't suppose it is anything
important," said the clergyman hastily.</p>

<p>Sir Graham said nothing more, but drank his
coffee and soon afterwards went off to his work.
Then Uniacke opened the letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class="bk2">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Cavendish Square</span>,</p>
<p class="rg2"><i>London, Dec.&mdash;</i></p></div>

<p class="cl1">"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir:</span></p>

<p>"I read your letter about my former patient, Sir
Graham Hamilton, with great interest. When he
consulted me I was fully aware that he was concealing
from me some mental trouble, which
reacted upon his bodily condition and tended to
retard his complete recovery of health. However,
a doctor cannot force the confidence of a patient
even in that patient's own interest, and I was,
therefore, compelled to work in the dark, and to
work without satisfaction to myself and lasting
benefit to Sir Graham. You now let in a strange
light upon the case, and I have little doubt what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
course would be the best to pursue in regard to
the future. Sir Graham's nervous system has
broken down so completely that, as often happens
in nervous cases, his very nature seems to
have changed. The energy, the remarkable self-confidence,
the hopefulness and power of looking
forward, and of working for the future, which have
placed him where he is&mdash;these have vanished. He
is possessed by a fixed idea, and imagines that it
is this fixed idea which has preyed upon him and
broken him down. But my knowledge of nerve-complaints
teaches me that the fixed idea follows
on the weakening of the nervous system, and seldom
or never precedes it. I find it is an effect
and not a cause. But it is a fact that the fixed
idea which possesses a man under such circumstances
is often connected, and closely, with the
actual cause of his illness. Sir Graham Hamilton
is suffering from long and habitual overwork in
connection with the sea; overwork of the imagination,
of the perceptive faculty, and in the mere
mechanical labour of putting on canvas what he
imagines and what he perceives. In consequence
of this overstrain and subsequent breakdown, he
has become possessed by a fixed sea-idea, and
traces all his wretchedness to this episode of the
boy and the picture. You will say I did not succeed
in curing him because I did not discover
what this fixed idea was. How can that be, if
the idea comes from the illness and not the illness
from the idea. In reply I must inform you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
that a tragic idea, once it is fixed in the mind of a
man, can, and often does, become in itself at last
a more remote, but effective, cause of the prolonged
continuance of the ill-health already started by
some other agent. It keeps the wound, which it
has not made, open. It is most important, therefore,
that it should, if possible, be banished, in the
case of Sir Graham as in other cases. Your amiable
deception has quite possibly averted a tragedy.
<i>Continue in it, I counsel you.</i> The knowledge that
his fears are well founded, that the boy&mdash;for whose
fate he morbidly considers himself entirely responsible&mdash;has
in very truth been lost at sea, and lies
buried in the ground beneath his feet, might, in
his present condition of invalidism, be attended
by most evil results. Some day it is quite possible
that he may be able to learn all the facts with
equanimity. But this can only be later when long
rest and change have accomplished their beneficent
work. It cannot certainly be now. Endeavour,
therefore, to dissuade him from any sort of creative
labour. Endeavour to persuade him to leave
the island. Above all things, do not let him know
the truth. It is a sad thing that a strong man of
genius should be brought so low that he has to be
treated with precautions almost suitable to a child.
But to a doctor there are many more children in
the world than a statistician might be able to
number. I wish I could take a holiday and come
to your assistance. Unfortunately, my duties tie
me closely to town at the present. And, in any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
case, my presence might merely irritate and alarm
our friend.</p>

<div class="bk2">
<p>"Believe me,</p>
<p class="rg2">Faithfully yours,</p>
<p class="rg4"><span class="smcap">John Braybrooke</span>."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="cl1">Uniacke read this letter, and laid it down with
a strange mingled feeling of relief and apprehension.
The relief was a salve that touched his
wounded conscience gently. If he had sinned, at
least this physician's letter told him that by his
sin he had accomplished something beneficent.
And for the moment self-condemnation ceased to
scourge him. The apprehension that quickly beset
him rose from the knowledge that Sir Graham
was in danger so long as he was in the Island.
But how could he be persuaded to leave it? That
was the problem.</p>

<p>Uniacke's reverie over the letter was interrupted
by the appearance of the painter. As he came into
the room, the clergyman rather awkwardly thrust
the doctor's letter into his pocket and turned to
his guest.</p>

<p>"In already, Sir Graham?" he said, with a
strained attempt at ease of manner. "Ah! work
tires you. Indeed you should take a long holiday."</p>

<p>He spoke, thinking of the doctor's words.</p>

<p>"I have not started work," the painter said.
"I've&mdash;I've been looking at that grave by the
church wall&mdash;the boy's grave."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" said Uniacke, with sudden coldness.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Uniacke, it seems&mdash;it seems
to me that the gravestone has been defaced."</p>

<p>"Defaced! Why, what could make such an
idea come to you?" exclaimed the clergyman.
"Defaced! But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is a gap in the inscription after the word
'Jack,'" the painter said slowly, fixing a piercing
and morose glance on his companion. "And it
seems to me that some blunt instrument has been
at work there."</p>

<p>"Oh, there was always a gap there," said Uniacke
hastily, touching the letter that lay in his
pocket, and feeling, strangely, as if the contact
fortified that staggering pilgrim on the path of
lies&mdash;his conscience. "There was always a gap.
It was a whim of the Skipper's&mdash;a mad whim."</p>

<p>"But I understood he was sane when his shipmate
was buried? You said so."</p>

<p>"Sane? Yes, in comparison with what he is
now. But one could not argue with him. He
was distraught with grief."</p>

<p>Sir Graham looked at Uniacke with the heavy
suspicion of a sick man, but he said nothing more
on the subject. He turned as if to go out. Uniacke
stopped him.</p>

<p>"You are going to paint?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Again Uniacke thought of the doctor's advice.</p>

<p>"Sir Graham," he said, speaking with obvious
hesitation, "I&mdash;I would not work."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You are not fit to bear any fatigue at present.
Creation will inevitably retard your recovery."</p>

<p>"I am not ill in body, and work is the only
panacea for a burdened mind. If it cannot bring
me happiness, at least&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Happiness!" Uniacke interrupted. "And
what may not bring that! Why, Sir Graham,
even death&mdash;should that be regarded as a curse?
May not death bring the greatest happiness of
all?"</p>

<p>The painter's forehead contracted, but the
clergyman continued with gathering eagerness and
fervour:</p>

<p>"Often when I pray beside a little dead child,
or&mdash;or a young lad, and hear the mother weeping,
I feel more keenly than at any other time the
fact that blessings descend upon the earth. The
child is taken in innocence. The lad is bereft of
the power to sin. And their souls are surely at
peace."</p>

<p>"At peace," said the painter heavily. "Yes, that
is something. But the mother&mdash;the mother
weeps, you say."</p>

<p>"Human love, the most beautiful thing in the
world must still be earth-bound, must still be
selfish."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir Graham, I'll confess to you even this, that
on Sunday evening, when, after the service, we
sang that hymn, 'Lead, Kindly Light,' I thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
would it not be a very beautiful thing if the body
mouldering beneath that stone in the churchyard
yonder were indeed the body of&mdash;of your wonder-child."</p>

<p>"Uniacke!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Don't you remember how he looked
up from his sordid misery to the rainbow?"</p>

<p>"How can I ever forget it?"</p>

<p>"Does that teach you nothing?"</p>

<p>There was a silence. Then the painter said:</p>

<p>"Death may be beautiful, but only after life
has been beautiful. For it is beautiful to live as
Jack would have lived."</p>

<p>"Is living&mdash;somewhere," interposed Uniacke
quickly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. I can't tell. But I hear the mother
weeping. I hear the mother weeping."</p>

<p>That night Uniacke lay long awake. He heard
the sea faintly. Was it not weeping too? It
seemed to him in that dark hour as if one power
alone was common to all people and to all things&mdash;the
power to mourn.</p>

<p>Next day, despite Uniacke's renewed protests,
Sir Graham began to paint steadily. The clergyman
dared not object too strongly. He had no
right. And brain-sick men are bad to deal with.
He could only watch over Sir Graham craftily and
be with him as much as possible, always hoping
that the painting frenzy would desert him, and
that he would find out for himself that his health
was too poor to endure any strain of labour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The moon was now past its second quarter, and
the weather continued cold and clear. Sir Graham
and Uniacke went out several times by night
to the belfry of the church, and the painter observed
the light effects through the narrow window.
In the daytime he made various studies
from memory of these effects. And presently
Uniacke began to grow more reconciled to this
labour of which&mdash;prompted by the doctor's letter&mdash;he
had at first been so much afraid. For it
really seemed that toil could be a tonic to this
man as to many other men. Sir Graham spoke
less of little Jack. He was devoured by the fever
of creation. In the evenings he mused on his
picture, puffing at his pipe. He no longer continually
displayed his morbid sorrow, or sought to
discuss at length the powers of despair. Uniacke
was beginning to feel happier about him, even to
doubt the doctor's wisdom in denouncing work as
a danger, when something happened which filled
him with a vague apprehension.</p>

<p>The mad Skipper, whom nothing attracted,
wandering vacantly, according to his sad custom,
about the graveyard and in the church, one day
ascended to the belfry, in which Sir Graham sat
at work on a study for the background of his
picture. Uniacke was with his friend at the
time, and heard the Skipper's heavy and
stumbling footsteps ascending the narrow stone
stairs.</p>

<p>"Who's that coming?" the painter asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Skipper," Uniacke answered, almost under
his breath.</p>

<p>In another minute the huge seaman appeared,
clad as usual in jersey and peaked cap, his large
blue eyes full of an animal expression of vacant
plaintiveness and staring lack of thought. He
showed no astonishment at finding intruders established
in his domain, and for a moment Uniacke
thought he would quietly turn about and make
his way down again. For, after a short pause, he
half swung round, still keeping his eyes vaguely
fixed on the artist, who continued to paint as if
quite alone. But apparently some chord of curiosity
had been struck in this poor and benumbed mind.
For the big man wavered, then stole rather furtively
forward, and fixed his sea-blue eyes on the
canvas, upon which appeared the rough wall of
the belfry, the narrow window, with a section of
wild sky in which a weary moon gleamed faintly,
and the dark arch of the stairway up which the
drowned mariners would come to their faithful
captain. The Skipper stared at all this inexpressively,
turned to move away, paused, waited. Sir
Graham went on painting; and the Skipper stayed.
He made no sound. Uniacke could scarcely hear
him breathing. He seemed wrapped in dull and
wide-eyed contemplation. Only when at last Sir
Graham paused, did he move away slowly down
the stairs with his loose-limbed, shuffling gait,
which expressed so plainly the illness of his mind.</p>

<p>In the rectory parlour, a few minutes later,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Uniacke and Sir Graham discussed this apparently
trifling incident. A feeling of unreasonable alarm
besieged Uniacke's soul, but he strove to fight
against and to expel it.</p>

<p>"How quietly he stood," said the painter. "He
seemed strangely interested."</p>

<p>"Yes, strangely. And yet his eyes were quite
vague and dull. I noticed that."</p>

<p>"For all that, Uniacke, his mind may be waking
from its sleep."</p>

<p>"Waking from its sleep!" said Uniacke, with
a sudden sharpness. "No&mdash;impossible!"</p>

<p>"One would almost think you desired that it
should not," rejoined Sir Graham, with obvious
surprise.</p>

<p>Uniacke saw that he had been foolishly unguarded.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he said, more quietly, "I only fear
that the poor fellow can never recover."</p>

<p>"Why not? From what feeling, from what
root of intelligence does his interest in my work
spring? May it not be that he vaguely feels as if
my picture were connected with his sorrow?"</p>

<p>Uniacke shook his head.</p>

<p>"I am not sure that it is impossible," continued
Sir Graham. "To-morrow I begin to make studies
for the figures. If he comes to me again, I shall
sketch him in."</p>

<p>Uniacke's uneasiness increased. Something
within him revolted from the association of his
guest and the Skipper. The hidden link between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
them was a tragedy, a tragedy that had wrecked the
reason of the one, the peace of the other. They
did not know of this link, yet there seemed horror
in such a companionship as theirs, and the clergyman
was seized with fear.</p>

<p>"You are going to draw your figures from
models?" he said, slowly, speaking to cover his
anxiety, and speaking idly enough.</p>

<p>The painter's reply struck away his uncertainty,
and set him face to face with a most definite dread.</p>

<p>"I shall have models," said Sir Graham, "for
all the figures except for little Jack. I can draw
him from memory. I can reproduce his face. It
never leaves me."</p>

<p>"What!" said Uniacke. "You will paint an
exactly truthful portrait of him then?"</p>

<p>"I shall; only idealised by death, dignified,
weird, washed by the sad sea."</p>

<p>"The Skipper watched you while you were painting.
He saw all you were doing."</p>

<p>"Yes. And I think he'll come again."</p>

<p>"But then&mdash;he'll&mdash;he'll see&mdash;"</p>

<p>The clergyman stopped short.</p>

<p>"See&mdash;see what?" Sir Graham asked.</p>

<p>"Himself," Uniacke replied, evasively. "When
you paint him with the ropes dropping from his
hands. May it not agitate, upset him, to see himself
as he stands ringing those bells each night?
Ah! there they are!"</p>

<p>It was twilight now, cold, and yellow, and grim;
twilight of winter. And the pathetic, cheerless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
appeal of the two bells stole out over the darkening
sea.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it may agitate him," Sir Graham said.
"What then? To strike a sharp blow on the
gates of his mind might be to do him a good service.
A shock expelled his reason. Might not a
shock recall it?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell," Uniacke said. "Such an experiment
might be dangerous, it seems to me, very
dangerous."</p>

<p>"Dangerous?"</p>

<p>Uniacke turned away rather abruptly. He
could not tell the painter what was in his mind, his
fear that the mad Skipper might recognise the
painted face of the dead boy, for whom he waited,
for whom, even at that moment, the bells were
ringing. And if the Skipper did recognise this
face that he knew so well&mdash;what then? What
would be the sequel? Uniacke thought of the
doctor's letter. He felt as if a net were closing
round him, as if there could be no escape from
some tragic finale. And he felt too, painfully, as
if a tragic finale were all that he&mdash;he, clergyman,
liar, trickster,&mdash;deserved. His conscience, in presence
of a shadow, woke again, and found a voice,
and told him that evil could not prevail for good,
that a lie could not twist the course of things
from paths of sorrow to paths of joy. Did not
each lie call aloud to danger, saying, "Approach!
approach!" Did not each subterfuge stretch out
arms beckoning on some nameless end? He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
seemed to hear soft footsteps. He was horribly
afraid and wished that, in the beginning of his
acquaintance with Sir Graham, he had dared consequence
and spoken truth. Now he felt like a
man feebly fighting that conqueror, the Inevitable,
and he went in fear. Yet he struggled still.</p>

<p>"Sir Graham," he said, on the following day,
"forgive me, but I feel it my duty to urge you
not to let that poor fellow watch you at work. It
is not safe. I do not think it is safe. I have a
strong feeling that&mdash;that the shock of seeing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Himself?"</p>

<p>"Exactly!&mdash;might be dangerous."</p>

<p>"To him?"</p>

<p>"Or to you. That is my feeling. Possibly to
you. He is not sane, and though he seems harmless
enough&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm fully prepared to take the risk," said Sir
Graham abruptly, and with a return of his old
suspicious expression. "I'm not afraid of the
man."</p>

<p>He got up and went out. The mere thought
of danger, in his condition, warmed and excited
him. He had resolved before actually starting
upon his picture to make some <i>plein air</i> studies
of the islanders. Therefore he now made his way
into the village, engaged a fisher-lad to stand to
him, returned to the rectory for his easel and set
it up just beyond the churchyard wall. He posed
the shamefaced and giggling boy and set to work.
Uniacke was writing in the small bow-window, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
pretending to write. Often he looked out, watching
the painter, waiting, with a keen anxiety, to
know whether the interest shown in his work by
the Skipper was only the passing whim of insanity,
or whether it was something more permanent,
more threatening perhaps.</p>

<p>The painter worked. The sailor posed, distending
his rough cheeks with self-conscious laughter.
Uniacke watched. It seemed that the Skipper
was not coming. Uniacke felt a sense of relief.
He got up from his writing-table at last, intending
to go into the village. As he did so, the tall form
of the Skipper came into view in the distance.
Dark, bulky, as yet far off, it shambled forward
slowly, hesitatingly, over the short grass towards
the painter. While Uniacke observed it, he
thought it looked definitely animal. It approached,
making d&eacute;tours, like a dog, furtive
and intent, that desires to draw near to some
object without seeming to do so. Slowly it
came, tacking this way and that, pausing frequently
as if uncertain or alarmed. And Uniacke,
standing in the shadow of the red curtain,
watched its movements, fascinated. He did not
know why, but he had a sensation that Fate,
loose-limbed, big-boned, furtive, was shambling
over the grass towards his guest. Sir Graham
went on quietly painting. The Skipper made a
last d&eacute;tour, got behind the painter, stole up and
peered over his shoulder. Once there, he seemed
spellbound. For he stood perfectly still and never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
took his large blue eyes from the canvas. Uniacke
went into the little passage, got his hat and hastened
out, impelled yet without purpose. As he
crossed the churchyard he saw Sir Graham put
something into the sailor's hand. The sailor
touched his cap awkwardly and rolled off. Uniacke
hurried forward.</p>

<p>"You've finished your work?" he said, coming
up.</p>

<p>Sir Graham turned and made him a hasty sign
to be silent.</p>

<p>"Don't alarm him," he whispered, with a slight
gesture towards the Skipper, who stood as if in
a vacant reverie, looking at the painted sailor
boy.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" Uniacke began.</p>

<p>"Hush!" the painter murmured, almost angrily.
"Leave us alone together."</p>

<p>The clergyman moved away with a sinking
heart. Indefinable dread seized him. The association
between these two men was fraught with
unknown peril. He felt that, and so strongly,
that he was almost tempted to defy convention
and violently interfere to put an end to it. But
he restrained himself and returned to the rectory,
watching the two motionless figures beyond the
churchyard wall from the parlour window as from
an ambush, with an intensity of expectation that
gave him the bodily sensation of a man clothed
in mail.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon Sir Graham showed him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
an admirable study of the Skipper, standing with
upraised arms as if ringing the church bells, his
blue eyes fixed as if he scanned a distant horizon,
or searched the endless plains of the sea for his
lost companions.</p>

<p>"Forgive my abruptness this morning," the
painter said. "I was afraid your presence would
scare the Skipper."</p>

<p>Uniacke murmured a word in admiration of the
painting.</p>

<p>"And to-morrow," he added.</p>

<p>"To-morrow I shall start on the picture," Sir
Graham replied.</p>

<p>After supper he drew aside the blind and looked
forth.</p>

<p>"The moon is rising," he said. "I shall go out
for a little while. I want to observe light effects,
and to think over what I am going to do. My
mind is full of it, Uniacke; I think it should be a
great picture."</p>

<p>His eyes were shining with excitement. He
went out. He was away a long time. The clock
in the rectory parlour struck eleven, half-past eleven,
he did not return. Beginning to feel anxious,
Uniacke went to the window and looked out. The
night was quiet and clear, bathed in the radiance of
the moon, which defined objects sharply. The dark
figure of the painter was approaching the house
from the church. Uniacke, who did not wish to be
thought curious, drew hastily back from the window
and dropped the blind. In a moment Sir Graham<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
entered. He was extremely pale and looked
scared. He shut the door very hastily, almost as if
he wished to prevent some one from entering after
him. Then he came up to the fire without a
word.</p>

<p>"You are late," Uniacke said, unpleasantly affected,
but trying to speak indifferently.</p>

<p>"Late, am I? Why&mdash;what time is it?"</p>

<p>"Nearly midnight."</p>

<p>"Indeed. I forgot the hour. I was engrossed.
I&mdash;" He looked up hastily and looked down again.
"A most strange, most unaccountable, thing has
happened."</p>

<p>"What?" said Uniacke. "Surely the Skipper
hasn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no. It's nothing to do with him. I
haven't seen him. No, no&mdash;but the most unaccountable&mdash;how
long have I been out there?"</p>

<p>"You went out at nine. It's a quarter to twelve
now."</p>

<p>"Two hours and three-quarters! I should have
said ten minutes. But then&mdash;how long was I with
it?"</p>

<p>"With it?" repeated Uniacke, turning cold.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;how long? It seemed no time&mdash;and
yet an eternity, too."</p>

<p>He got up and went to and fro uneasily about
the room.</p>

<p>"Horrible!" he muttered, as if to himself. "Horrible!"</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly in front of Uniacke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you believe," he said, "that when we think
very steadily and intensely of a thing we may, perhaps,
project&mdash;give life, as it were, for the moment
to our thought?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask me?" said Uniacke. "It
has never happened to me to do such a thing."</p>

<p>"Why do I ask? Well, I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>He hesitated, keeping his eyes fixed on Uniacke's
face.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll tell you what took place. I went out
thinking of my picture, of its composition, of the
light effect, of the faces of the drowned men,
especially of the face of little Jack. I seemed to
see him coming into that belfry tower&mdash;yes, to
greet the Skipper, all dripping from the sea. But&mdash;but&mdash;no,
Uniacke, I'll swear that, in my mind,
I saw his face as it used to be. That was natural,
wasn't it? I imagined it white, with wide, staring
eyes, the skin wet and roughened with the salt
water. But that was all. So it couldn't have been
my thought projected, because I had never imagined.&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was evidently engrossed by his own reflections.
His eyes had an inward expression. His
voice died in a murmur, almost like the murmur
of one who babbles in sleep.</p>

<p>"Never had imagined what?" said Uniacke,
sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, forgive me. I cannot understand it. As
I paced in the churchyard, thinking of my picture,
and watching the moon and the shadows cast by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the church and by the stones of the tombs, I came
to that grave by the wall."</p>

<p>"The grave of the boy I told you about?" said
Uniacke with an elaborate indifference.</p>

<p>"Yes, the boy."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I stood there for a few minutes, or
it may have been longer. I can't tell at all. I
don't think I was even aware that I was no longer
walking. I was entirely wrapped up in my meditations,
I believe. I saw my picture before me,
the Skipper, the dripping sailors&mdash;Jack first. I saw
them quite distinctly with my mental vision. And
then, by degrees, somehow those figures in the picture
all faded into darkness, softly, gradually, till
only one was left&mdash;Jack. He was still there in
the picture. The moonlight through the narrow
belfry window fell on him. It seemed to make the
salt drops sparkle, almost like jewels, in his hair,
on his clothes. I looked at him,&mdash;mentally, still.
And, while I looked, the moonlight, I thought,
grew stronger. The belfry seemed to fade away.
The figure of Jack stood out in the light. It grew
larger&mdash;larger. It reached the size of life. And
then, as I stared upon it, the face altered before
my eyes. It became older, less childish, more
firm and manly&mdash;but oh, Uniacke! a thousand
times more horrible."</p>

<p>"How? How?"</p>

<p>"Why, it became puffy, bloated, dropsical.
The eyes were glazed and bloodshot. On the lips<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
there was foam. The fingers of the hands were
twisted and distorted. The teeth grinned hideously.
The romance of death dropped away.
The filthy reality of death stood before me, upon
the grave of that boy."</p>

<p>"You imagined it," muttered Uniacke.</p>

<p>He spoke without conviction.</p>

<p>"I did not. I saw it. For now I knew that I
was no longer thinking of my picture. I looked
around me and saw the small clouds and the night,
the moon in the pale sky, the black church, this
house, the graves like creatures lying side by side
asleep. I saw them all. I heard the dull wash of
the sea. And then I looked again at that grave,
and on it stood Jack, the dead thing I sent to
death, bloated and silent, staring upon me. Silent&mdash;and
yet I seemed to feel that it said, 'This is
what I am. Paint me like this. Look at what
the sea has done to me! Look&mdash;look at what the
sea has done!'&mdash;Uniacke! Uniacke!"</p>

<p>He sank down into a chair and stared before
him with terrible eyes. A shudder ran over the
clergyman, but he said, in a voice that he tried to
make calm and consolatory,</p>

<p>"Of course it was your fancy, Sir Graham. You
had conjured up the figures in your picture.
There was nothing unnatural in your seeing one&mdash;the
one you had known in life&mdash;more distinctly
than the others."</p>

<p>"I had not known it like that. I had never
imagined anything so distorted, so horrible, tragic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and yet almost grotesque, a thing for the foolish
to&mdash;to laugh at, ugh! Besides, it stood there.
It was actually there on that grave, as if it had
risen out of that grave, Uniacke."</p>

<p>"Your fancy."</p>

<p>Uniacke spoke with no conviction, and his lips
were pale.</p>

<p>"I say it is not. The thing&mdash;Jack, come to
that!&mdash;was there. Had you been with me, you
must have seen it as I did."</p>

<p>Uniacke shook his head.</p>

<p>"Believe me, Sir Graham," he exclaimed, "you
ought to go from here. The everlasting sound of
the sea&mdash;the presence of the Skipper&mdash;your idea
for this terrible picture&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Terrible! Yes, I see it must be terrible. My
conception&mdash;how wrong it was! I meant to make
death romantic, almost beautiful. And it is like
that. To-morrow&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;ah, Jack! I can
paint you now!"</p>

<p>He sprang up and hurried from the room.
Uniacke heard him pacing up and down above
stairs till far into the night.</p>

<p>The clergyman was deeply and sincerely religious,
but he was in nowise a superstitious man.
Association with Sir Graham, however, and the
circumstances attendant upon that association, had
gradually unnerved him. He was now a prey
to fear, almost to horror. Was it possible, he
thought, as he sat listening to that eternal footfall
overhead, that Providence permitted a spirit to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
rise from the very grave to proclaim his lie, and
to show the truth in a most hideous form? He
could almost believe so. It seemed that the dead
boy resented the defacement of his tomb, resented
the deliberate untruth which concealed from the
painter his dreary destiny, and came up out of the
other world to proclaim the clergyman's deception.
It seemed as if God himself fought with a miraculous
means the battle of truth and tore aside the
veil in which Uniacke had sought to shroud the
actuality of death. Uniacke could not bring himself
to speak to the painter, to acknowledge the
trickery resorted to for a sick man's sake. But
this vision of the night paralysed his power to
make any further effort in deception. He felt benumbed
and impotent. A Power invisible to him
fought against him. He could only lay down his
weapons,&mdash;despicable, unworthy, as they were,&mdash;and
let things take their course, while he looked
on as one in a sad dream, apprehensive of the
ending of that dream.</p>

<p>Sir Graham began his picture on the morrow.
His first excitement in the conception of it, which
had been almost joyous, was now become feverish
and terrible. He was seized by the dreary passion
of the gifted man who means to use his gifts
to add new and vital horrors to the horrors of life.
He no longer felt the pathos, the almost exquisite
romance, of his subject. He felt only its tragic,
its disgusting terror. While he painted feverishly
the mad Skipper hovered about him, with eyes still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
vacant but a manner of increasing unrest. It
seemed as if something whispered to him that this
work of a stranger had some connection with his
life, some deep, though as yet undiscovered, meaning
for him. The first figure in the picture was
the Skipper himself. When it was painted the
likeness was striking. But the poor mad seaman
stared upon it with an ignorant vagueness. It
was evident that he looked without seeing, that
he observed without comprehending.</p>

<p>"Surely he will not know Jack," Uniacke
thought, "since he does not know his own face."</p>

<p>And he felt a faint sense of relief. But this
passed away, for the unrest of the Skipper seemed
continually to grow more marked and seething.
Uniacke noticed it with gathering anxiety. Sir
Graham did not observe it. He thought of nothing
but his work.</p>

<p>"I shall paint Jack last of all," he said grimly,
to Uniacke. "I mean to make a crescendo of
horror, and in Jack's figure the loathsomeness of
death shall reach a climax. Yes, I will paint him
last of all. Perhaps he will come again and pose
for me upon that grave." And he laughed as he
sat before his easel.</p>

<p>"What painter ever before had such a model?"
he said to Uniacke.</p>

<p>And that night after supper, he got up from
the table saying:</p>

<p>"I must go and see if Jack will give me a sitting
to-night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Uniacke rose also.</p>

<p>"Let me come with you," he said.</p>

<p>Sir Graham stopped with his hand on the door.
There was a smile on his lips, but his eyes were
full of foreboding.</p>

<p>"Do you want to see Jack, then?" he asked,
with a dreadful feigning of jocularity. "But you
are not a painter. You require no model, living
or dead." He burst again into a laugh.</p>

<p>"Let me come with you," the clergyman
repeated doggedly.</p>

<p>Sir Graham made no objection, and they went
out together.</p>

<p>The moon was now growing towards the full,
but it was yet low in the sky, and the night was
but faintly lit, as a room is lit by a heavily shaded
lamp. Sir Graham's manner lost its almost piteous
bluster as he stood on the doorstep and felt
the cold wind that blew from the wintry sea. He
set his lips, and his face twitched with nervous
agitation as he stole a furtive glance at the clergyman,
whose soft hat was pulled down low over
his eyes as if to conceal their expression.</p>

<p>The two men walked forward slowly into the
churchyard. Uniacke's heart was beating with
violence and his mind was full of acute anticipation.
Yet he would scarcely acknowledge even
to himself the possibility of such an appearance
as that affirmed by Sir Graham. They drew near
to the grave of little Jack, round which the chill
winds of night blew gently and the dull voices<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of the waves sang hushed and murmurous nocturnes.
Uniacke was taken by an almost insurmountable
inclination to pause, even to turn back.
Their progress to this grave seemed attended by
some hidden and ghastly danger. He laid his
hand upon the painter's arm, as if to withhold him
from further advance.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Sir Graham asked, speaking
almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Uniacke, dropping his hand.</p>

<p>Sir Graham's eyes were full of sombre questioning
as they met his. Moving slowly on, the
two men stood at length by Jack's grave. The
moon rose languidly, and shed a curious and
ethereal twilight upon the stone at its head. The
blurred place from which Uniacke had struck the
name was plainly visible. Instinctively the
clergyman's eyes sought the spot and stared
upon it.</p>

<p>"Does it not bear all the appearance of having
been defaced?" said Sir Graham in his ear.</p>

<p>Uniacke shook his head.</p>

<p>"The Skipper would have it so," he murmured,
full of a heavy sense of useless contest against the
determination of something hidden that all should
be known to his companion, perhaps even that
very night.</p>

<p>They waited, as mourners wait beside a tomb.
As the moon rose, the churchyard grew more distinct.
The surrounding graves came into view,
the crude bulk of the rectory, the outline of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
church tower, and the long wall of the churchyard.
On the white faces of the two men the light fell
pitilessly, revealing the strained and anxious expression
of Uniacke, the staring watchfulness of
the painter. The minutes ran by. Uniacke shivered
slightly in the wind. By degrees he began to
lose the expectation of seeing any apparition.
Presently he even sneered silently at himself for
his folly in having ever entertained it. Nevertheless
he was strongly affected by the nearness of
the wonder-child's grave, from which seemed to
emanate an influence definite and searching, and&mdash;so
he felt&mdash;increasingly hostile, either to himself
or to the artist. It came up like a thing that
threatened. It crept near like a thing that would
destroy. Uniacke wondered whether Sir Graham
was conscious of it. But the painter said nothing,
and the clergyman dared not ask him. At length,
however, his fanciful sense of this dead power,
speaking as it were from the ground under
his feet, became so intolerable to him that he was
resolved to go; and he was about to tell Sir Graham
of his intention when the painter suddenly
caught his arm in a tight grip.</p>

<p>"There it is," he whispered.</p>

<p>He was staring before him over the grave. Uniacke
followed his eyes. He saw the short grass
stirring faintly in the night wind. He thought it
looked like hair bristling, and his hair moved on his
head. He saw the churchyard in a maze of moon-rays.
And with the moonlight had come many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
shadows. But not one of them was deceptive.
Not one took the form of any spectre. Nevertheless
Uniacke recoiled from this little grave at his
feet, for it seemed to him as if the power that
had been sleeping there stirred, forsook its recumbent
position, rose up warily, intent on coming
forth to confront him.</p>

<p>"You see it?" whispered Sir Graham, still keeping
hold of his arm.</p>

<p>"No, no I see nothing; there is nothing. It's
your fancy, your imagination that plays tricks on
you."</p>

<p>"No, it's Jack. Oh, Uniacke, see&mdash;see how he
poses! He knows that I shall paint him to-morrow.
How horrible he is! Do the drowned
always look like that?"</p>

<p>"Come away, Sir Graham. This is a hideous
hallucination. Come away."</p>

<p>"How he is altered. All his features are coarsened,
bloated. My wonder-child! He is tragic
now, and he is disgusting. How loathsomely he
twists his fingers! Must I paint him like that&mdash;with
that grinning, ghastly mouth&mdash;little Jack?
Ah! ah! He poses&mdash;he poses always. He would
have me paint him now,&mdash;here in the moonlight&mdash;here&mdash;here&mdash;standing
on this grave!"</p>

<p>"Sir Graham, come with me!" exclaimed
Uniacke.</p>

<p>And this time he forcibly drew his companion
with him from the grave. The painter seemed inclined
to resist for a moment. He turned his head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and looked long and eagerly behind him. Then
suddenly he acquiesced.</p>

<p>"It has gone," he said. "You have driven it
away."</p>

<p>Uniacke hurried forward to the Rectory. That
night he implored the painter for the last time to
leave the island.</p>

<p>"Can't you feel," he said, almost passionately,
"the danger you are running here, the terrible
danger to yourself? The sea preys upon your
mind. You ought not to be near it. Every
murmur of the waves is suggestive to your ears.
The voices of those bells recall to your mind the
drowning of men. The sigh of that poor maniac
depresses you perpetually. Leave the sea. Try to
forget it. I tell you, Sir Graham, that your mind
is becoming actually diseased from incessant
brooding. It begins even to trick your eyes in
this abominable way."</p>

<p>"You swear you saw nothing?"</p>

<p>"I do. There was nothing. You have thought
of that boy until you actually see him before you."</p>

<p>"As he is?"</p>

<p>"As he is not, as he will never be."</p>

<p>The painter got up from his chair, came over to
Uniacke, and looked piercingly into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Then you declare&mdash;on your honour as a priest,"
he said slowly, "that you do not know that my
wonder-child is the boy who is buried beneath that
stone?"</p>

<p>"I buried that boy, and I declare on my honour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
as a priest that I do not know it," Uniacke
answered, desperately but unflinchingly.</p>

<p>It was his last throw for this man's salvation.</p>

<p>"I believe you," the painter said.</p>

<p>He returned to the fireplace, and leaned his face
on his arm against the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"I believe you," he repeated presently. "I have
been mistaken."</p>

<p>"Mistaken&mdash;how?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes I have thought that you have lied
to me."</p>

<p>Uniacke's heart grew heavier at the words.</p>

<p>In the morning Sir Graham said to him, with a
curious calmness:</p>

<p>"I think perhaps you are right, Uniacke. I
have been considering your words, your advice."</p>

<p>"And you will take it?" Uniacke said, with a
sudden enormous sense of gratefulness.</p>

<p>"I think I shall."</p>

<p>"Think&mdash;Sir Graham!"</p>

<p>"I'll decide to-night. I must have the day to
consider. But&mdash;yes, you are right. That&mdash;that
horrible appearance. I suppose it must be evoked
by the trickery of my own brain."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly."</p>

<p>"There can be no other reason for it?"</p>

<p>"None&mdash;none."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then, yes, I had better go from here.
But you will come with me?"</p>

<p>"To London?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere&mdash;it does not matter."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked round him wistfully.</p>

<p>"If I am to leave the island," he said sorrowfully,
"it does not matter where I go."</p>

<p>"To London then," Uniacke said, almost joyously.
"I will make my arrangements."</p>

<p>"To-morrow?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow. Yes. Excuse me for the present.
I must run over to the mainland to settle about the
Sunday services. I shall be back in a few hours."</p>

<p>He went out, feeling as if a weight had been
lifted from brain and heart. So good could come
out of evil. Had he not done right to lie? He
began to believe that he had. As he crossed to
the mainland he wrapped himself in warm and
comfortable sophistries. The wickedness of subterfuge
vanished now that subterfuge was found
to be successful in attaining a desired end. For
that which is successful seldom appears wholly
evil. To-day Uniacke glowed in the fires of his
sinfulness.</p>

<p>He transacted his business on the mainland and
set out on his return home, driving through the
shallow sea in a high cart. The day, which had
opened in sunshine, was now become grey, very
still and depressing. An intense and brooding
silence reigned, broken by the splashing of the
horse's hoofs in the scarcely ruffled water, and by
the occasional peevish cackle of a gull hovering,
on purposeless wings, between the waters and the
mists. The low island lay in the dull distance
ahead, wan and deprecatory of aspect, like a thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
desiring to be left alone in the morose embrace of
solitude. Uniacke, gazing towards it out of the
midst of the sea, longed ardently for the morrow
when Sir Graham would be caught away from this
pale land of terror. He no longer blamed himself
for what he had done. Conscience was asleep.
He exulted, and had a strange feeling that God
smiled on him with approval of his sin.</p>

<p>As he reached the island, the grey pall slightly
lifted and light broke through the mist. He came
up out of the sea, and, whipping the wet and
weary horse, drove along the narrow lanes towards
the Rectory. But when he came within hail of
the churchyard all his abnormal exultation was
suddenly quenched, and the oppressive sense of
threatening danger which had for so long a time
persecuted him, returned with painful force. He
saw ahead of him Sir Graham seated before his
easel painting. Behind the artist, bending down,
his eyes fixed intently on the canvas, his huge
hands gripping one another across his chest, stood
the mad Skipper. As the wheels of the cart
ground the rough road by the churchyard wall,
Sir Graham looked up and smiled.</p>

<p>"I'm doing a last day's work," he called.</p>

<p>Uniacke stopped the cart and jumped out. The
Skipper never moved. His eyes never left the
canvas. He seemed utterly absorbed.</p>

<p>"You are not working on the picture?" said
Uniacke hastily.</p>

<p>"No."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank God."</p>

<p>"Why d'you say that?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;the subject was so horrible."</p>

<p>"This is only a study. I shall leave the picture
as I am leaving the Island. Perhaps some
day&mdash;" He paused. Then he said: "I call this
'Sea Change.' Go indoors. In about half an
hour I will come and fetch you to see it. Where
will you be?"</p>

<p>"In my little room at the back of the house. I
have some letters to write."</p>

<p>"I'll come there. Don't disturb me, till then.
I think the picture will be strange&mdash;and I hope
beautiful."</p>

<p>And again he smiled. Reassured, Uniacke
made his way into the Rectory. He sat down at
his writing-table, took up his pen and wrote a few
words of a letter. But his mind wandered. The
pen dropped on the table and he fell into thought.
It was strangely still weather, and there was a
strange stillness in his heart and conscience, a
calm that was sweet to him. He felt the relief of
coming to an end after a journey that had not
been without dangers. For, during his intercourse
with Sir Graham, he had often walked upon the
edge of tragedy. Now he no longer looked down
from that precipice. He leaned his arm on the
table, among the litter of papers connected with
parish affairs, and rested his head in his hand.
Almost unconsciously, at that moment he began
to rejoice at his own boldness in deviating from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the strict path of uncompromising rectitude. For
he thought of it as boldness, and of his former
unyielding adherence to the principles he believed
to be right, as timidity. After all, he said to himself,
it is easy to be too rigid, too strict. In all
human dealings we must consider not only ourselves,
but also the individuals with whom we
have to do. Have we the right to injure them by
our determination to take care of the welfare of
our own souls? It seemed to him just then as if
virtue was often merely selfishness and implied a
lack of sympathy with others. He might have
refused to lie and destroyed his friend. Would
not that have been selfishness? Would not that
have been sheer cowardice? He told himself that
it would.</p>

<p>Calm flowed upon him. He was lost in the
day-dream of the complacent man whose load of
care has fallen away into the abyss from which he
has fortunately escaped. The silence of the Island
was intense to-day. His conscience slept with the
winds. And the sea slept too with all its sorrow.
He sat there like a carven figure with his face in
his hand. And, by degrees, he ceased to feel, to
think actively. Conscious, not asleep, with open
eyes he remained in a placid attitude, lulled in the
arms of a quiet happiness.</p>

<p>He was distracted at length by some sound at
a distance. It broke through his day-dream. At
first he could not tell what it was, but presently
he became aware that a hoarse voice was ejaculating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
some word outside, probably in the churchyard.
He took his hand from his face, sat up
straight by the writing-table and began to listen,
at first with some slight irritation. For he had
been happy in his day-dream. The voice outside
repeated the word. Uniacke thought of the street-cries
of London to which he was going, and that
this cry was like one of them. He heard it again.
Now it was nearer. Short and sharp, it sounded
both angry and&mdash;something else&mdash;what? Dolorous,
he fancied, keen with a horror of wonder and
of despair. He remembered where he was, and
that he had never before heard such a cry on the
Island. But he still sat by the table. He was
listening intently, trying to hear what was the
word the voice kept perpetually calling.</p>

<p>"Jack! Jack!"</p>

<p>Uniacke sprang up, pushing back his chair violently.
It caught in a rug that lay on the bare
wooden floor and fell with a crash to the ground.</p>

<p>"Jack! Jack!"</p>

<p>The word came to his ears now in a sort of
strident howl that was hardly human. He began
to tremble. But still he did not recognise the
voice.</p>

<p>"Jack!"</p>

<p>It was cried under the window of the parlour,
fiercely, frantically. Uniacke knew the voice for
the mad Skipper's. He delayed no longer, but
hastened to the front room and stared out across
the churchyard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The Skipper, with his huge hands uplifted, his
fingers working as if they strove to strangle something
invisible in the air, was stumbling among
the graves. His face was red and convulsed with
excitement.</p>

<p>"Jack!" he shouted hoarsely, "Jack!"</p>

<p>And he went on desperately towards the sea,
pursuing&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>Uniacke looked away from him towards the
place where Sir Graham had been painting. The
easel stood there with the canvas resting upon the
wooden pins. On the ground before it was huddled
a dark thing.</p>

<p>Uniacke went out from his house. Although
he did not know it he walked very slowly as if he
dragged a weight. His feet trod upon the graves.
As he walked he could hear the hoarse shout of
the skipper dying away in the distance towards
the sea.</p>

<p>"Jack!"</p>

<p>The voice faded as he gained the churchyard
wall.</p>

<p>The dark thing huddled at the foot of the easel
was the painter's dead body. On his discoloured
throat there were the marks of fingers. Mechanically
Uniacke turned his eyes from those purple
and red marks to the picture the dead man had
been painting. He saw the figure of a boy in a
seaman's jersey and long sea-boots dripping with
water. The face of the boy was pale and swollen.
The mouth hung down hideously. The hair was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
matted with moisture. Only the eyes were beautiful,
for they looked upward with a rapt and
childlike expression.</p>

<p>"He sees the rainbow!" murmured the clergyman.</p>

<p>And he fell forward against the churchyard wall
with his face buried in his arms. The voice of
the grey sea was very loud in his ears. Darkness
seemed to close in on him. He had done evil to
do good, and the evil he had done had been in
vain. His heart beat hard, and seemed to be in
his throat choking him. And in the darkness he
saw a vision of a dirty child, dressed in rags and
a tall paper cap, and pointing upwards.</p>

<p>And he heard a voice, that sounded far off and
unearthly, say:</p>

<p>"Look at that there rainbow! Look at that
there rainbow!"</p>

<p>He wondered, as a man wonders in a dream,
whether the dead painter heard the voice too, but
more clearly&mdash;and elsewhere.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
<h2>"WILLIAM FOSTER."</h2>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>
<h2 class="hd1">"WILLIAM FOSTER."</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> sad cold day in London, city of sad cold
days, a man in a Club had nothing on earth to do.
He had glanced through the morning papers and
found them full of adjectives and empty of news.
He had smoked several cigarettes. He had exchanged
a word or two of gossip with two or
three acquaintances. And he had stared moodily
out of a bow window, and had been rewarded by
a vision of wet paving stones, wet beggars and
wet sparrows. He felt depressed and inclined to
wonder why he existed. Turning from the
window to the long room at his back he saw an
elderly Colonel yawning, with a sherry and bitters
in one hand and a toothpick in the other.
He decided not to remain in the Club. So he
took his hat and went out into the street. It was
raining in the street and he had no umbrella. He
hailed a hansom and got in.</p>

<p>"Where to, sir?" asked the cabby through the
trap door.</p>

<p>"What?" said the man.</p>

<p>"Where to, sir?"</p>

<p>"Oh! go to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>He tried to think of some place where he might
contrive to pass an hour or two agreeably.</p>

<p>"Sir?" said the cabby.</p>

<p>"Go to Madame Tussaud's," said the man.</p>

<p>It was the only place he could think of at the
moment. He had lived in London for years but
he had never been there. He had never had the
smallest desire to go there. Wax and glass eyes
did not attract him. Dresses that hung from
corpses, which had never been alive, did not
appeal to him. Nor did he care for buns. He
had never been to Tussaud's. He was only going
there now because literally, at the moment, he
knew not where to go. He leaned back in the
cab and looked at the wet pedestrians, and at the
puddles.</p>

<p>When the cab stopped he got out and entered
a large building. He paid money at a turnstile
and drifted aimlessly into a waxen world. Some
fat men in strange costumes, with bulging eyes
like black velvet, and varying expressions of
heavy lethargy, played Hungarian music on violins.
It was evident that they did not thrill themselves.
Their aspect was at the same time fierce
and dull, they looked like volcanoes that had been
drenched with water. The man passed on, the
music grew softer and the waxen world pressed
more closely round. Kings, cricketers, actresses,
and statesmen beset him in vistas. He trod a
maze of death that had not lived. There were
very few school treats about, for the fashionable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
school treat season had not yet fully set in. So
the man had the wax almost entirely to himself.
He spread his wings to it like a bird to the air.
By degrees, as he wandered&mdash;pursued by the distant
music from the drenched volcanoes&mdash;a feeling
of suffocation overtook him. All these men
and women about him stared and smiled, but all
were breathless. They wore their gaudy clothes
with an air, no doubt. The Kings struck regal
attitudes. The cricketers had a set manner of
bringing off dreamy, difficult catches. The
actresses were properly made up to charm, and
the statesmen must surely have brought plenty
of empires to ruin, if insipidity has power to
cause such wreckage. But they were all decisively
breathless. They seemed caught by some
ghastly physical spell. And this spell was laid
also upon the man who wandered among them.
The breath of life withdrew from him to a long,
long distance&mdash;he fancied. He felt as one who,
taken by a trance, is bereft of power though not
of knowledge. The staring silence was as the
silence of a tomb, whose walls were full of eyes,
intent and fatigued. He started when a person
in uniform, hitherto apparently waxen, said in a
cockney voice,</p>

<p>"See the Chamber of Horrors, sir?" But he
recovered in time to acquiesce.</p>

<p>He descended towards a subterranean vault:
as if to a lower circle of this inferno full of breathless
demons. Here there were no rustic strangers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
no clergymen with their choirs, no elderly ladies
in command of "Bands of Hope." The silence
was great, and the murderers stood together in
companies, looking this way and that as if in
search of victims. Some sat on chairs or stools.
Some crouched in the dock. Some prepared for
a mock expiation in their best clothes. One was
at work in his house, digging in quicklime a hole
the length of a human body. His waxen visage
gleamed pale in the dim light, and he appeared to
pause in his digging and to listen for sounds
above his head. For he was in the cellar of his
house.</p>

<p>The man stood still and looked at him. He
had a mean face. All the features were squeezed
and venomous, and expressive of criminal desires
and of extreme cruelty. And so it was with
most of his comrades. They varied in height, in
age, in social status and in colouring. But upon
all their faces was the same frigid expression, a
sort of thin hatefulness touched with sarcasm.
The man wandered on among them and saw it
everywhere, on the lips of a youth in rags, in the
eyes of an old woman in a bonnet, lurking in the
wrinkles of a labourer, at rest upon the narrow
brow of a doctor, alive in the puffed-out wax
of an attorney's bloated features. Yes, it was
easy to recognise the Devil's hall-mark on them
all, he thought. And he wondered a little how
it came about that they had been able, in so
many cases, to gain the confidence of their unhappy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
victims. Here, for instance, were the man
and woman who had lured servant girls into the
depths of a forest and there murdered them for
the sake of their boxes. Even the silliest girl,
one would have supposed, must have fled in
terror from the ape-like cunning of those wicked
faces. Here was the housekeeper who had made
away with her aged mistress. Surely any one
with the smallest power of observation would
have refused to sit in the evening, to sleep at
night, in company with so horrible a countenance.
Here was the man who killed his paramour with
a knife. How came he to have a paramour?
The desire to kill lurked in his bony cheeks, his
small, intent eyes, his narrow slit of a mouth, but
no desire to love. God seemed to have set his
warning to humanity upon each of these creatures
of the Devil. Yet they had deceived mankind
to mankind's undoing. They had won confidence,
respect, even love.</p>

<p>The man was confused by this knowledge, as
he moved among them in the dimness and the
silence, brushing the sleeve of one, the skirt of
another, looking into the curiously expressive
eyes of all. But presently his wondering recognition
of the world's fatuous and frantic gullibility
ceased. For at the end of an alley of
murderers he stood before a woman. She was
young, pretty and distinguished in appearance.
Her features were small and delicate. Her brow
was noble. Her painted mouth was tender and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
saintly; and, though her eyes were sightless,
truth and nobility surely gazed out of them. For
a moment the man was seized by a conviction
that a mistake had been made by the proprietors
of the establishment, and that some being,
famous for charitable deeds, or intellect, or heroic
accomplishment had been put in penance among
these tragic effigies. He glanced at her number,
consulted his catalogue, and found that this
woman was named Catherine Sirrett, and that
she had been convicted of the murder of her
husband by poison some few years before. Then
he looked at her again and, before this criminal,
he felt that she might, nay, must, have deceived
any man, the most acute and enlightened observer.
No one could have looked into that face
and seen blackness in the heart of that woman.
Everyone must have trusted her. Many must
have loved her. Her appearance inspired more
than confidence&mdash;reverence; there was something
angelic in its purity. There was something religious
in its quiet gravity. His heart grew
heavy as he looked at her, heavy with a horror
far more great than any that had overcome him
as he examined the bestial company around.
And when he came away, and long afterwards,
Catherine Sirrett's face remained in his memory
as the most horrible face in all that silent, watchful
crowd of beings who had wrought violence
upon the earth. For it was dressed in deceit.
The other faces were naked. So he thought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
He did not know Catherine Sirrett's story,
though he remembered that a woman of her
name had been hanged in England some years
before, when he was in India, and that she had
gained many sympathisers by her bearing and
roused some newspaper discussion by her fate.</p>

<p>This is her story, the inner story which the
world never knew.</p>

<hr class="hr1" />

<p>Catherine Sirrett's mother was an intensely,
even a morbidly, religious woman. Her father
was an atheist and an &aelig;sthete. Yet her parents
were fond of each other at first and made common
cause in spoiling their only child. Sometimes
the mother would whisper in the little
girl's ear that she must pray for poor father who
was blind to the true light and deaf to the beautiful
voice. Sometimes the father would tell her
that if she would worship she must worship
genius, the poet, the painter, the musician; that
if she would pray she must pray to Nature, the
sea, the sunset and the spring-time. But as a
rule these two loving antagonists thought it was
enough for their baby, their treasure, to develop
quietly, steadily, in an atmosphere of adoration,
in which arose no mist of theories, no war of
words. Till she was ten years old Catherine was
untroubled. At that age a parental contest began
to rage&mdash;at first furtively,&mdash;about her. With the
years her mother's morbidity waxed, her father's
restraint waned. The one became more intensely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and frantically devout, the other more frankly
pagan. And now, as the child grew, and her
mind and heart stood up to meet life and girlhood,
each of her parents began to feel towards
her the desire of sole possession. She had been
brought up a Christian. The father had permitted
that. So long as she was an ignorant infant
he had felt no anxiety to attach her to his
theories. But when he saw the intelligence growing
in her eyes, the dawn of her soul deepening,
there stirred within him a strong desire that she
should face existence as he faced it, free from
trammels of superstition. The mother, with the
quick intuition of woman, soon understood his
unexpressed feeling and thrilled with religious
fear. Although&mdash;or indeed because&mdash;she loved
her husband so much she was tortured by his lack
of faith. And now she was alarmed at the
thought of the effect his influence might have
upon Catherine. She was roused to an intense
activity of the soul. She said nothing to her
husband of her fear and horror. He said nothing
to her of his secret determination that his only
child should grow up in his own faithless faith.
But a silent and determined battle began to rage
between them for the possession of Catherine's
soul. And, at last, this battle turned the former
love of the parents into a sort of uneasy hatred.
The child did not fully comprehend what was
going on around her, but she dimly felt it. And
it influenced her whole nature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Her mother, who was given over to religious
forms, who was ritualistic and sentimental as well
as really devout and fervent, at first gained the
ascendancy over Catherine. Holy but narrow-minded,
she compressed the girl's naturally expansive
temperament, and taught her something
of the hideous and brooding melancholy of the
bigot and the fanatic. Then the father, quick-sighted,
and roused to an almost angry activity
by his appreciation of Catherine's danger, threw
himself into the combat, and endeavoured to imbue
the girl with his own comprehension of life's
meaning, exaggerating all his theories in the endeavour
to make them seem sufficiently vital and
impressive. Catherine lived in the centre of this
battle, which became continually more fierce, until
she was eighteen. Then she fell in love with
Mark Sirrett, married him, and left her parents
alone with their mutual hostility, now complicated
by a sort of paralysis of surprise and sense of
mutual failure. They had forgotten that their
child's future might hold a lover, a husband.
Now they found themselves in the rather absurd
position of enemies who have quarrelled over a
shadow which suddenly vanishes away. They
had lost their love for each other, they had lost
Catherine. But her soul, though it was given to
Mark Sirrett, had not lost their impress. Both
the Puritanism of her mother and the paganism
of her father were destined to play their parts in
the guidance of her strange and terrible destiny.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Mark Sirrett, when he married Catherine, was
twenty-five, dark, handsome, warm-hearted and
rich. It seemed that he had an exceptionally
sweet and attractive nature. He had been an
affectionate son, a kind brother in his home, a
generous comrade at school and college. Everybody
had a good word for him; his family, his
tutors, his friends, his servants. Like most young
and ardent men he had had some follies. At least
they were never mean or ungenerous. He entered
upon married life with an unusually good record.
Those who knew him casually, even many who
knew him well, considered that he was easily
read, that he was transparently frank, that,
though highly intelligent, he was not particularly
subtle, and that no still waters ran deep in Mark
Sirrett. All these people were utterly wrong.
Mark had a very curious side to his nature, which
remained almost unsuspected until after his marriage
with Catherine, but which eventually was
to make a name very well known to the world.
He was, although apparently so open, in reality
full of reserve. He was full of ambition. And
he had an exceptionally peculiar, and exceptionally
riotous, imagination. And this imagination
he was quite determined to express in an art&mdash;the
art of literature. But his reserve kept him
inactive until he had left Oxford, when he went
to live in London, where eventually he met Catherine.</p>

<p>His reserve, and his artistic hesitation to work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
until he felt able to do good work, held Mark's
imagination in check as a dam holds water in
check. He sometimes wrote, but nobody knew
that he wrote except one friend, Frederic Berrand.
And Berrand could be a silent man.
Even to Catherine, when he fell in love with her
and wooed her, Mark did not reveal his desire
for fame, or his intention to win it. The girl
loved her lover for what he was, but not for all
he was. Of the still water that ran deep she as
yet knew nothing. She thought her husband,
who was rich, who appeared gay, who had lived
so far, as it seemed, idly enough, would continue
to live with her, as he had apparently lived without
her, brightly, honestly, a little thoughtlessly,
a little vainly.</p>

<p>She had no sort of suspicion that she had
married that very curious phenomenon&mdash;a born
artist. Had her mother suspected it she would
have been shocked. Had her father dreamed it
he would have been delighted. And Catherine
herself? well, she was still a child at this time.</p>

<p>She and Mark went to Spain for their honeymoon,
and lived in a tiny white villa at Granada.
It stood on the edge of the hill whose crown is
the exquisite and dream-like Alhambra. Its long
and narrow garden ran along the hillside, a slope
of roses and of orange flowers, of thick, hot grass
and of tangled green shrubs. The garden wall
was white and uneven, and almost hidden by
wild, pink flowers. Beneath was spread the plain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
in which lies the City, bounded by the mountains
over which, each evening, the sun sets. And
every day the drowsy air hummed in answer to
the huge and drowsy voice of the wonderful Cathedral
bell, which struck the hours and filled
this lovely world with almost terrible vibrations
of romance. In the thick woods that steal to the
feet of the ethereal Palace the murmur of the
streams was ever heard, and the white snows of
the Sierra Nevada stared over the yellow and
russet plain, and were touched with a blue blush
as the night came on.</p>

<p>Catherine, although she loved her parents and
had never fully realised the enmity grown up between
them, felt a strange happiness, that was
more than the happiness of new-born passion, in
her emancipation. She was by nature exquisitely
sensitive, and she had often been vaguely troubled
by the contest between her parents. Their fighting
instincts had sometimes set her face to face
with a sort of shadowed valley, in whose blackness
she faintly heard the far-off clash of weapons.
Now she was caught away from this subtle tumult,
and as she looked into her husband's vivacious
dark eyes she felt that a little weight which had
lain long on her heart was lifted from it. She
had thought herself happy before, now she knew
herself utterly happy. Life seemed to have no
dark background. Even love itself was not
spoiled by a too great wonder of seriousness.
They loved in sunshine and were gay&mdash;like grasshoppers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
in the grass that the sun has filled with
a still rapture of warmth. Not till two days before
their departure for England was this chirping,
grasshopper mood disturbed or dispelled.</p>

<p>At one end of the long and narrow garden
there was a little crude pavilion, open to the air
on three sides. The domed roof was supported
on painted wooden pillars up which red and
white roses audaciously climbed. Rugs covered
the floor. A wooden railing ran along the front
facing the steep hillside. The furniture was
simple and homely, a few low basket chairs and
an oval table. In this pavilion the newly married
pair took tea nearly every afternoon after
their expeditions in the neighbourhood, or their
strolls through the sunny Moorish Courts.
After tea they sat on and watched the sunset,
and fancied they could see the birds that flew
away above the City towards the distant mountains
drop down to their nests in Seville ere the
darkness came. This last evening but one was
intensely hot; the town at their feet seemed
drowning in a dust of gold. Cries, softened and
made utterly musical, rose up to them from this
golden world, beyond which the sky reddened as
the sun sank lower. Sometimes they heard the
jingling bells of mules and horses in the hidden
streets; they saw the pigeons circling above the
house-tops, and doll-like figures moving whimsically
in gardens that seemed as small as pocket-handkerchiefs.
Thin laughter of playing children<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
stole to them. And then the huge and veiled
voice of the Cathedral bell tolled the hour, like
Time become articulate.</p>

<p>A voice may have an immense influence over a
sensitive nature. This bell of the Cathedral of
Granada has one of the most marvellous voices
in the world, deep with a depth of old and vanished
ages, heavy with the burden of all the
long-dead years, and this evening it seemed suddenly
to strike away a veil from Catherine's
husband. She was leaning her arms on the
painted railing and searching the toy city with
her happy eyes. Mark, standing behind her, was
solicitously winding a shawl round her to protect
her from the chill that falls from the Sierra Nevada
with the dropping downward of the sun.
As the bell tolled, Catherine felt that Mark's
hands slipped from her shoulders. She glanced
round and up at him. He was standing rigid. His
eyes were widely opened. His lips were parted.
All the gaiety that usually danced in his face had
disappeared. He looked like an entranced man.</p>

<p>"Mark!" Catherine exclaimed. "Mark! why,
how strange you look!"</p>

<p>"Do I?" he said, staring out over the wide
plain below.</p>

<p>The voice of the bell died reluctantly on the
air, but some huge and vague echo of its heavy
romance seemed to sway, like a wave, across the
little houses to the sunset and faint towards
Seville.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, you look sad and stern. I have never
seen your face like this&mdash;till now."</p>

<p>He made no answer.</p>

<p>"Are you sad because we are going so soon?"
she asked. "But then why should we go? We
are perfectly happy here. There is nothing to
call us away."</p>

<p>"Kitty, does not that bell give you the lie?"
he answered.</p>

<p>"The bell of the Cathedral?" she asked,
wondering.</p>

<p>"Yes. Just now when I listened to it, I
seemed to hear it whispering of the mysterious
things of life, of the hidden currents in the great
river, of the sorrows, of the terrors, of the
crimes."</p>

<p>"Mark!" said Catherine in amazement.</p>

<p>"Nothing to call us away from our idle happiness
here!" he continued. "Do you say&mdash;nothing?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;no. For we are free; we have no
ties. You have no profession, Mark. You have
no art even to call you back to England. Dear
father&mdash;how he worships the arts!"</p>

<p>"And you, Kitty&mdash;you?"</p>

<p>Mark spoke with a curious pressure of excitement.</p>

<p>"He has taught me to love them too."</p>

<p>"How much, Kitty? As he loves them, more
than anything else on earth?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>She had never heard him speak at all like this.
She answered:</p>

<p>"Ah no. For my mother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused.</p>

<p>"My mother has made me understand that
there is something greater than any art, more
important, more beautiful."</p>

<p>"What can that be?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mark&mdash;religion!"</p>

<p>He leaned over the railing at her side, and the
white and red roses that embraced the pillar
shook against his thick dark hair in the infant
breeze of evening.</p>

<p>"But there are many religions," he said. "A
man's art may be his religion."</p>

<p>A troubled look came into her eyes and made
them like her mother's.</p>

<p>"Oh no, Mark."</p>

<p>"Yes, Kitty," he said, with growing earnestness,
putting aside his reserve for the first time
with her. "Indeed it may."</p>

<p>"You mean when he uses it to do good?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. The roses shivered.</p>

<p>"The true artist never thinks of that. To have
a definite moral purpose is destructive."</p>

<p>The City at their feet was sinking into shadow
now, and the air grew cold, filled with the snowy
breath of the Sierra.</p>

<p>"When we go back to England I will teach
you the right way to follow an art, to worship it;
the way that will be mine."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yours, Mark? But I don't understand."</p>

<p>"No," he said. "You don't understand all of
me yet, Kitty. Do you want to?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>There was a sound of fear in her voice. Mark
sat down beside her and put his arm round her.</p>

<p>"Kitty," he began. "I'm only on the threshold
of my life, of my real life, my life with you
and with my work."</p>

<p>"You are going to work?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes. That bell just now seemed to strike
the hour of commencement&mdash;to tell me it was
time for me to begin. I should like, some day&mdash;far
in the future, Kitty,&mdash;to hear it strike that
other hour, the hour when I must finish, when
the little bit of work that I can do in the world
is done. I shan't be afraid of that hour any
more than I'm afraid of this one. Perhaps, when
you and I are old we shall come here again, and
listen to that bell once more, the same, when we
are changed."</p>

<p>He pointed towards the Cathedral which was
still touched by the sun. Catherine leaned
against his shoulder. She said nothing, and did
not move.</p>

<p>"Everything in life has its appointed recorder,"
he continued. "They are a big band, the band
of the recorders who strive accurately to write
down life as it is. Well, Kitty, I am going to be
one of that band."</p>

<p>"You are going to be a writer, Mark?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then, you will record the beauty, the joy, the
purity, the goodness of life?"</p>

<p>His usually bright face had become sombre and
thoughtful. It looked strangely dark and saturnine
in the twilight.</p>

<p>"I shall record what I see most clearly."</p>

<p>"And what is that?"</p>

<p>"Not the things on the surface, but the things
beneath the surface, of life."</p>

<p>And then he told Catherine more fully of his
ambition and gave her a glimpse of the hidden
side of his duplex nature.</p>

<p>She gazed up at him in the gathering twilight
and it seemed to her that she was looking at a
stranger. The climbing roses still shook against
Mark in the wind. While he talked his voice
grew almost fierce, and his dark eyes shone like
the eyes of a fanatic. When he ceased to speak,
Catherine's lips were pursed together, like her
mother's when she listened to the pagan rhapsodies
of Mr. Ardagh.</p>

<p>Two days later the Sirretts left Granada for
England.</p>

<hr class="hr1" />

<p>On their return they paid a short visit to
Catherine's parents, who were living in Eaton
Square. Mr. and Mrs. Ardagh received them
with a sort of dulled and narcotic affection. In
truth, for different reasons, the Puritan and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
pagan cherished a certain resentment against the
man who had stepped in and robbed them of
their cause of warfare. Nevertheless they desired
his company in their house. For each was anxious
to study him and to discover what influence he
was likely to have upon Catherine. During
her daughter's absence Mrs. Ardagh had found
the emptiness of her childless life insupportable,
and she had, therefore, engaged a young girl,
called Jenny Levita, to come to her every day
as companion. Jenny was intelligent and very
poor, bookish and earnest, even ardent in nature.
Mrs. Ardagh gained a certain amount of interest
and pleasure from forming the pliant mind of
her prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, who was with her always from
eleven till six in the evening, who read aloud to
her, accompanied her on her charitable missions,
and took&mdash;so far as a stranger might,&mdash;the place
of Catherine in her life. Catherine met Jenny
upon the doorstep of her parents' house on the
evening of her arrival, and hastened to ask her
mother who the slim girl, with the tall figure,
narrow shoulders, fluffy brown hair, and large
oriental eyes was.</p>

<p>"My paid daughter," said Mrs. Ardagh, almost
bitterly. "But she can't fill the place of my lost
Catherine."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Catherine discovered that her
mother was truly attached to Jenny.</p>

<p>"I took her partly because she is easily led,"
she said, "easily influenced and so very pretty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and poor. I want to save her for God, and when
I met her there was one who wished to lead her
to the devil. She won't see him now. She won't
hear his name."</p>

<p>Then she dropped the subject.</p>

<p>Catherine was alternately questioned by her
father and by her mother as to the influence of
Mark. But something within her prevented her
from telling them of the conversation in the
Pavilion, when the cries of the toy city died down
into the night. Mrs. Ardagh, now sinking in the
confusion of a rather dreary middle age, complicated
by a natural melancholy, and by incessant
confession to a ritualistic clergyman seductive in
receptivity, was relieved to think that Mark was
harmless.</p>

<p>Art for Art's sake&mdash;the motto of her husband&mdash;had
apparently little meaning for Mark. As
Mrs. Ardagh thought it the devil's motto she was
glad of this and said so to Catherine. Mr. Ardagh,
on the other hand, was vexed to find Mark
apparently so frivolous; and he also expressed
his feelings to Catherine, who became slightly
confused.</p>

<p>"I should like to see your husband doing
something," he said. "You have much of me in
you, Kit, despite your poor dear mother's extravagant
attempts to limit your reading to Frances
Ridley Havergal. Why didn't you marry an
artist, eh? A painter or an author, somebody
who can give us more beauty than we have already,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
or more truth? You're too good for
Frances Ridley Havergal. Leave her to your
mother and that girl, Jenny, who is like wax in
your mother's hands and the hands of the Rev.
Father Grimshaw. Piff!"</p>

<p>Catherine said nothing, but she sought an opportunity
of seeing something of Jenny. She
found it, just before the day on which she and
Mark were to leave London for their country
house. Jenny had come as usual one morning,
to read aloud to Mrs. Ardagh. They were just
then deep in the "Memoirs" of a certain pious
divine, whose chief claim upon the attention and
gratitude of posterity seemed to be that, during
a very long career, he had "confessed" more
Anglican notabilities than any of his rivals, and
had used up, in his church, an amount of incense
that would have put a Roman Catholic priest to
shame. On the morning in question the reading
was interrupted. Mrs. Ardagh was called away
to consult with a lay-worker in the slums upon
some scheme for reclaiming the submerged
masses, and Catherine, running in to her mother's
boudoir after a walk with Mark, found the tall,
narrow-shouldered girl with the oriental eyes
sitting alone with the apostolic memoirs lying
open upon her knees. Catherine was not sorry.
She took off her fur coat and sat down.</p>

<p>"What are you and my mother reading, Miss
Levita?" she asked.</p>

<p>Jenny told her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it interesting?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it ought to be," Jenny answered,
thoughtlessly.</p>

<p>Then a flush ran over her thin cheeks, on which
there were a great many little freckles.</p>

<p>"I mean that it is very interesting," she
added. "Your mother will tell you so, Mrs.
Sirrett."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But I was asking your opinion."</p>

<p>It struck Catherine that Jenny had her opinion
and was scarcely as compliant as Mr. Ardagh evidently
supposed her to be. At Catherine's last remark
Jenny glanced up. The two girls looked
into each other's eyes, and, in Jenny's, Catherine
thought she saw a flickering defiance.</p>

<p>"I was asking your opinion," she repeated.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Sirrett," Jenny said, more hardily,
"I don't know why it is. I admire and love
goodness, yes, as your mother&mdash;who's a saint, I
think&mdash;does. But I'll tell you frankly that I
think it's often very dull to read about. Don't
you think so?"</p>

<p>She blushed again, and let the heavy white lids
droop over her eyes, which had glittered almost
like the eyes of a fever patient while she was
speaking.</p>

<p>"Only when dull people write about it, surely,"
said Catherine.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Jenny said, twisting her black
stuff dress with nervous fingers. "I often think
that in the books of the cleverest authors there are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
dull moments, and that those dull moments are
nearly always when the good, the really excellent,
characters are being written about."</p>

<p>"And in real life, Miss Levita?" asked Catherine.
"Do you find the good people duller, less
interesting, than the bad ones in real life?"</p>

<p>"I haven't known many very bad ones, Mrs.
Sirrett."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;but those you have known!"</p>

<p>Jenny hesitated. She was obviously embarrassed.
She even shifted, like an awkward child,
in her chair. But there was something of obstinate
honesty in her that would have its way.</p>

<p>"If you must know,&mdash;I mean, if you care to
know, please," she said at length, "the most
interesting person I ever met was&mdash;yes, I suppose
he was a wicked man."</p>

<p>Her curious, sharp-featured, yet attractive, face
was hot all over as she finished. Catherine divined
at once that she was speaking of the person who,
according to Mrs. Ardagh, had wished "to lead
her to the devil." At this moment, while the
two girls were silent, Mrs. Ardagh returned to
the room. As Catherine left it she heard the soft
and high voice of Jenny taking up once more the
parable of the highly-honoured divine.</p>

<p>Catherine was not altogether sorry when she
and her husband left Eaton Square for the house
in Surrey which Mark had rented for the summer
months.</p>

<p>In this house the young couple were to face for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the first time the reality of married life. Hitherto
they had only faced its romance.</p>

<p>The house was beautiful in an old-fashioned
way. Its rooms were low and rather dark. A
wood stood round it. The garden was a wild clearing,
fringed with enormous clumps of rhododendron.
Wood doves cooed in the trees like invisible
lovers unable to cease from gushing.
Under the trees ferns grew in masses. Squirrels
swarmed, and in the huge rhododendron flowers
the bees lost themselves in an ecstasy of sipping
sensuality. It was a fine summer, and this house
was made to be a summer house. In winter it
must have been but a dreary hermitage.</p>

<p>The servants greeted them respectfully. The
horses neighed in the stables. The dogs barked,
and leaped up in welcome, then, when they were
noticed and patted, depressed their backs in
joyous humility, and, lifting their flexible lips,
grinned amorously, glancing sideways from the
hands that they desired. It was an eminently
unvulgar, and ought to have been a very sweet,
home-coming.</p>

<p>But was it sweet to Catherine?</p>

<p>She asked herself that question, and the fact
that she did so proved that it was not wholly
sweet. Already the future oppressed her. In
this house, which seemed full of the smell of the
country, of the very odour of peace, she felt that
the stranger, the second Mark&mdash;scarcely known
to her as yet&mdash;was to be born, was to gain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
strength and grow. She feared him. She watched
for him. But, for the first few days, he did not
show himself. The grasshoppers chirped and revelled
in the grass. Mark and Catherine sat in
the wood, wandered on the hills, rode in the
valleys, cooed a little even, like the doves hidden
in the green shadows of the glades, and making
ceaseless music. The lovers&mdash;for they were still
lovers at this time&mdash;made a gay dreamland for
themselves. But dreams cannot and ought not
to last. If they did they would become painfully
enervating. One day, in the wood, Mark
resumed the conversation of the Pavilion.</p>

<p>"Because I am rich I must not be idle, Kitty,"
he said.</p>

<p>And into his dark eyes there crept that look of
the stranger man.</p>

<p>"Thank God that I am rich," he added.</p>

<p>"Why, Mark dear?"</p>

<p>"Because I can dare to do what sort of work
I choose," he answered. "The pot boils without
my labour. So I am independent of the public,
whom I will win in my own way. If I have to
wait it will not matter."</p>

<p>And then, speaking with growing enthusiasm,
he gave Kitty a sketch of a book he had projected.
The doves cooed all through the plot,
which was a sad and terrible one, very uncommon
and very unlike Mark. Catherine listened to it
with, alternately, the mind of her father and the
mind of her mother. It was the old antagonism<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of the Puritan and the pagan. But now it raged
in one person instead of in two, as the girl sat
under the soft darkness of the trees, listening to
the eager voice of her boy husband, who was beginning
at last to cast the skin of his reserve.
The voice went on and on, interrupted only by
the doves. But sometimes Catherine felt as if
she leaned upon the painted railing of the Pavilion,
and heard the distant cries of the golden
City. At last Mark said,</p>

<p>"Kitty, that is what I mean to do."</p>

<p>"It is terrible," she said.</p>

<p>And she pursed her lips like her mother.</p>

<p>"Yes," Mark answered, with enthusiasm. "It
is terrible. It is ghastly."</p>

<p>Catherine looked at him with an intense and
growing surprise. She was wondering how the
conception of such horrors could take place in a
man so gay as Mark.</p>

<p>At last she said,</p>

<p>"Mark, you feel your own power, do you not?"</p>

<p>"Kitty," he replied quietly, almost modestly,
yet with a firm gravity that was strong, "I do
feel that I have something to say and that I
shall be able to say it in my book. I have waited
a long while. Now I believe that I am ready,
that it is time for me to begin."</p>

<p>"Then, Mark, if you feel that you have this
power, don't you feel a desire to conquer the
greatest difficulties in your art, to show that you
can succeed where others have failed?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked at her curiously, realising that she
had something to say to him, and that she was
trying to prepare the way before it.</p>

<p>"Come, Kitty," he said. "Say what you wish
to say. You have the right. What is it?"</p>

<p>Catherine told him of her conversation with
Jenny.</p>

<p>"That little thin girl," he said. "So she
thinks wickedness more interesting, more many-sided
than virtue, more dramatic in its possibilities.
Well, she and I are agreed. But what
was it you wanted?"</p>

<p>"Mark, I want you to prove to her&mdash;to everyone&mdash;that
it is not so."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"By writing a different kind of book&mdash;a noble
book. You can do it. Where others have
failed, you can succeed."</p>

<p>He laughed at her, gaily.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, some day, I'll try," he said. "But
I can only write at present what I have conceived.
Till this book is done, I can think of
nothing else. I see you are interested, Kitty.
I must tell you all I am intending to do."</p>

<p>He continued, until it was quite evening, expatiating
on the force with which he intended to
realise in literature the terrors that trooped in
his imagination. And by the time he had finished
and darkness stood under the trees, Catherine
was carried away by the pagan spirit. She
thought no more of the possible harm the projected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
book might work in sensitive natures.
She thought only of its power, which she
acclaimed.</p>

<p>Mark kissed her with a solemnity of passion he
had never shown before, and they went back to
the house.</p>

<p>It was an immense relief to Mark to open his
book of revelation and to allow Catherine to read
these pages in it. But he could not be continuously
unreserved to any human being. And
that evening he subsided into his former light-hearted
gaiety, and shrouded the stranger man
in an impenetrable veil. Catherine sat with him
in wonderment, while the moon came up behind
the trees and shone over the clearing before the
house. She did not yet understand the inflexible
secrecies of genius. A nightingale sang. Its
voice was so sweet that Catherine felt as if the
whole world were full of tenderness and of sympathy.
She said so to Mark, just as she was
turning from him to go to bed.</p>

<p>"Ah, Kitty," he said, "there are other things
in the world besides tenderness and sympathy,
thank Heaven. There are terrors, there are
crimes, there are strange and fearful things both
within us and outside of us."</p>

<p>"How sad that is, Mark!" said Catherine.</p>

<p>He smiled at her gaily&mdash;cruelly, she thought a
moment afterwards when she was alone in her
bedroom.</p>

<p>"Sad?" he said. "I don't think so, for I love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
drama. Life is dramatic. If it were not it would
be intolerable."</p>

<p>And still the nightingale sang. But he did not
hear it. Catherine heard it till she fell asleep.</p>

<p>Now Mark began to write with assiduity.
Catherine busied herself with her household
duties, with the garden and with charities in the
neighbouring Parish. Her mother's rather hysterical
beliefs lost their hysteria in her, at this period,
and were softened and rendered large hearted.
Catherine's sympathy with the world was indeed
a living thing, not simply a fine idea. While
Mark was shut up every morning with his writing
she visited the poor, sat by the sick, and played
with the village children. The Parish&mdash;this came
out forcibly at her trial,&mdash;grew to love her. She
was the prettiest Lady Bountiful. The impress
made upon her by her mother was visible in all
this. For Mrs. Ardagh, rigid, melancholy as
she was sometimes, was genuinely charitable,
genuinely dutiful. If she adored the forms of
religion she loved also its essence,&mdash;the doing of
good. In these many mornings Catherine was
like her mother&mdash;improved. But in the evenings
she no longer resembled Mrs. Ardagh, but rather,
in a degree, echoed her father, and responded to
his vehement, if furtive, teachings. For in the
evenings Mark read to her what he had written
during the day and discussed it with her in all
its bearings. He recognised the clear quickness
of Catherine's intellect. Yet she very soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
noticed that he was exceedingly inflexible with
regard to his work. He liked to discuss, he did
not like to alter, it.</p>

<p>One night, when he had finished the last completed
chapter, he laid down the manuscript and
said,</p>

<p>"Well, Kitty?"</p>

<p>Catherine was lying on a couch near the open
French window. She did not speak until Mark
repeated,</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>Then she said,</p>

<p>"I think that far the finest chapter of your
book&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mark smiled triumphantly.</p>

<p>"But it seems to me terribly immoral," she
finished.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right, dear. So long as it is
properly worked out, inevitable."</p>

<p>"It teaches&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Kitty&mdash;nothing. It merely describes
what is."</p>

<p>"But surely it may do harm."</p>

<p>"Not if it is truly artistic. And you
think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It that? Yes, I do. But, Mark, art is not
all."</p>

<p>"Your father would say so."</p>

<p>"My father&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"And he is right. I neither inculcate nor do
I condemn. I only produce, or try to produce, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
work of art. You admire the chapter? You
think it truly dramatic?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do&mdash;that's just why I am afraid of
it."</p>

<p>"Little timorous bird."</p>

<p>He came over to the sofa and kissed her tenderly.
She shivered. She thought his lips had
never been dry and cold like that before.</p>

<p>The book was finished by the end of the summer.
It was published in November and created
a considerable sensation. Mark issued it under
the name of "William Foster." Only Catherine
and his friend Frederic Berrand knew who William
Foster really was. The newspapers praised
the workmanship of the book almost universally.
But many of them severely condemned it as
dangerous, morbidly imaginative, horrible in subject,
and likely to do great mischief because of
its undoubted power and charm. It was forbidden
at some libraries.</p>

<p>Mark was delighted with its reception. Now,
that he had brought forth his child, he seemed
more light-hearted, gay and boyish than ever.
His too vivid imagination had been toiling. It
rested now. Catherine and he came up to town
for the winter. They meant to spend only their
summers in Surrey. They took a house in
Chester Street, and often dined with the Ardaghs
in Eaton Square. At one of these dinners Jenny
Levita was present. Mark, remembering what
Catherine had told him about her in Surrey,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
looked at her with some interest, and talked to
her a little in his most light-hearted way. She
replied briefly and without much apparent animation,
seeming indeed rather absent-minded and
distraite. Presently Mr. Ardagh said,</p>

<p>"This new man, William Foster, is that very
rare thing in England&mdash;a pitiless artist. He has
the audacity of genius and the fine impersonality."</p>

<p>Catherine started and flushed violently. As
she did so she saw Jenny's long dark eyes fixed
earnestly upon her. Mark smiled slightly. Mrs.
Ardagh looked pained.</p>

<p>"His book is doing frightful harm, I am
sure," she said.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, my dear," said her husband.
"Nothing so absolutely right, so absolutely
artistic, can do harm."</p>

<p>An obstinate expression came into Mrs. Ardagh's
face, but she said nothing. Catherine
looked down at her plate. She felt as if small
needles were pricking her all over.</p>

<p>"Have you read the book?" said Mr. Ardagh
to his wife.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied. "It was recommended to
me, I began it not knowing what sort of book
it was."</p>

<p>"And did you finish it?" asked her husband,
with rather a satirical smile.</p>

<p>"Yes. I confess I could not leave off reading
it. That is why it is so dangerous. It is both
powerful and evil."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the subject dropped. Mark was still
smiling quietly, but Catherine's face was grave.
When she and her mother and Jenny went up
into the drawing-room, leaving the men to their
cigarettes, Catherine recurred to the subject of
"William Foster's" book.</p>

<p>"Do you really think that a novel can do
serious harm, mother?" she began. "After all,
it is only a work of the imagination. Surely
people read it and forget it, as they would not
forget an actual fact."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ardagh sighed wearily. She was a pale
woman with feverish eyes. The expression in
them grew almost fierce as she answered,</p>

<p>"It is the black imagination of this William
Foster that will come like a suffocating cloud
upon the imaginations of others, especially of&mdash;&mdash;"
She suddenly broke off. Catherine, wondering
why, glanced up at her mother and saw that she
was looking towards the far end of the big drawing-room.
Jenny was sitting there, under a
shaded lamp. She had some work in her hands
but her hands were still. Her head was turned
away, but her attitude, the curve of her soft, long,
white throat, the absolute immobility of her thin
body betrayed the fact that she was listening
attentively.</p>

<p>"I would not let that child read William
Foster's book for the world," Mrs. Ardagh
whispered to Catherine.</p>

<p>Then she changed the subject, and spoke of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
some charity that she was interested in at the
East End of London. Jenny's hands instantly
began to move about her embroidery.</p>

<p>That night Catherine spoke to Mark of what
her mother had said.</p>

<p>He only laughed.</p>

<p>"I cannot write for any one person, Kitty," he
said, "or if I do it must be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For whom?" she asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Myself," he replied.</p>

<p>Catherine slept very badly that night. She
was thinking of William Foster and of Mark.
They seemed to her two different men. And she
had married&mdash;which?</p>

<p>Mark did no work in London. He knew too
many people, he said, and besides, he wanted to
rest. Catherine and he went out a great deal
into society. At Christmas they ran over to
Paris and spent three weeks there. During this
holiday William Foster, it almost seemed, had
ceased to exist. Mark Sirrett was light-hearted,
gay, and the kindest, most thoughtful husband
in the world. When they came back to London,
Catherine went at once to see her mother. Mr.
Ardagh had gone to the Riviera and Catherine
found Mrs. Ardagh quite alone in the big house
in Eaton Square.</p>

<p>"Why, where is Jenny Levita?" she asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ardagh made no reply for a moment.
Her face, which was rather straw-colour than
white, worked grotesquely as if under the influence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of some strong emotion that she was trying
to suppress. At length she said, in a chill, husky
voice,</p>

<p>"Jenny has left me."</p>

<p>"Left you&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"She was taken away from me. She was taken
back to the sin from which I hoped I had rescued
her."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother! By whom?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ardagh put her handkerchief to her eyes.</p>

<p>"William Foster," she answered.</p>

<p>Catherine felt cold and numb.</p>

<p>"William Foster&mdash;I don't understand," she
said slowly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ardagh rolled and unrolled her handkerchief
with trembling fingers.</p>

<p>"She got hold of that book&mdash;that black, wicked
book," she said, and there was a sort of fury in
her voice. "It upset her faith. It tarnished her
moral sense. It reminded her of the&mdash;the man
from whose influence I had drawn her. All her
imagination was set in a flame by that hateful
chapter."</p>

<p>"Which one?" Catherine asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ardagh mentioned the chapter which
Catherine had most hated, most admired, and
most feared.</p>

<p>"I fought with William Foster for Jenny's
soul," she said, passionately. "But I am not
clever. I have no power. I am getting old and
tired. She cried. She said she loved me, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
that goodness was not for her, that she must go,
that life was calling her, that she must live&mdash;live!
William Foster had shown her death and
she thought it life. I always knew that in Jenny
good and evil were fighting, that her fate was
trembling in the balance. That book turned the
scale."</p>

<p>She sobbed heavily, then with a catch of her
breath, she added,</p>

<p>"William Foster is a very wicked man."</p>

<p>Catherine flushed all over her face. But she
said nothing. That night she told Mark of
Jenny's fate. She expected him to be grieved.
But he was not.</p>

<p>"An author who respects his art cannot consider
every hysterical girl while he is writing," he
said. "And, besides, it is only your mother's
idea that she was influenced by my book. Long
ago she showed you the bent of her mind."</p>

<p>"But, Mark, don't you remember how that
chapter struck me when you first read it to me?"</p>

<p>"I remember that you thought it the finest
chapter in the book, and you were right, Kitty.
You've got artistic discernment, like your father.
Berrand and you would get on together. Directly
he comes back I'll introduce you to each
other."</p>

<p>Catherine said no more. From that time she
devoted herself more than ever to her mother,
who now, under the influence of sorrow, allowed
her nature to come to its full flower. Abandoning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the pleasures of society, which had long
wearied her, she gave herself up to services, charities
and good works in the poor parts of London.
She carried Catherine with her on many of her
expeditions, and there can be no doubt that her
fervour and curious exaltation had a marked
effect upon the girl. Catherine had always been
highly susceptible to influence, but she had been
during most of her life attacked perpetually by
two absolutely opposite influences. Now one of
these, her father's, was removed from her. She
came more than ever before under her mother's
domination. For Mark, when he was not "William
Foster," was simply a high-spirited and
happy youth, full of energy and of apparently
normal desires and intentions. He had that sort
of genius which can be long asleep in the dark,
while its possessor dances, like a mote, in sunshine.</p>

<p>In the spring the Sirretts made ready to leave
London. As the day drew near for their departure
Mark's manner changed, and he displayed
symptoms of restlessness and of impatience.
Catherine noticed them and asked their
reason.</p>

<p>"I am longing to return to 'William Foster,'
Kitty," he said.</p>

<p>She felt a sharp pain at her heart, but she only
smiled and replied,</p>

<p>"I almost thought you had forgotten him."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I have been preparing to
meet him again all these months."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>His dark eyes shone as he spoke. And once
again that stranger stood before Catherine. She
turned and went upstairs, saying that she must
see to her packing. But when she was alone in
her bedroom she shed some tears. That afternoon
she went to Eaton Square to bid her mother
good-bye. Mrs. Ardagh was looking unhappy.</p>

<p>"Your father returns from Italy on Wednesday,"
she said. "You'll just miss him."</p>

<p>"I am so sorry, mother," Catherine said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ardagh looked at her in silence for a moment.
Then she said in a low voice,</p>

<p>"I am not."</p>

<p>"Mother&mdash;but why?"</p>

<p>"I think you are better away from him. My
heart tells me so. Oh, Kitty, I thank God every
day of my life that Mark is&mdash;is such a good fellow,
without those terrible ideas and theories of your
poor father. You cannot think what I suffer."</p>

<p>It was the first time she had ever spoken so
plainly on the subject, and even now she quickly
changed to another topic. Mark had never introduced
poor Mrs. Ardagh to "William Foster."
And Catherine would not add another burden to
those she already had to bear.</p>

<p>Surrey was looking very lovely in the spring
weather. The trees were just beginning to let
out the tips of their green secrets. The ground
was dashed with blue and with yellow, where
bloomed those flowers that are the sweetest of
the year because they come the first, and whisper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
wonderful promises in the ears of all who
love them. There had been some rain and the
grass of lawns and hillsides was exquisite in the
startling freshness of its vivid colour. Nature
seemed uneasy with delight, like a child on a
birthday morning. The tender beauty of everything
around her reassured Catherine, who had
come from town in a mood of strange apprehension.
As she looked at the expectant woods
awaiting their lovely costume in fragile nudity, at
the violets that seemed to sing in odours, at that
pale and shallow sky which is a herald of the
deeper skies to come, it seemed to her impossible
that Mark, who could be so blithe, so radiant,
could turn to dark imaginings in such an atmosphere
of exquisite enterprise. She was filled with
hope and with a species of religious optimism.
Some days passed, Catherine and Mark spent
them in a renewal of friendship with their domain.
They were like two children and were
gayer than the spring. Then one evening Mark
said,</p>

<p>"And now, Kitty, I am going to start work
again. Berrand has written that he will be in England
next week and will come on here at once.
But he won't disturb me. And my scheme is
ready."</p>

<p>Catherine felt the breath fluttering in her
throat as she murmured,</p>

<p>"Your scheme is ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It's a great one. Berrand thinks so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
I have written something of it to him. I am
going to trace the downfall of a nature from
nobility to utter degradation."</p>

<p>His eyes sparkled with enthusiasm, as he repeated
in thrilling tones,</p>

<p>"Utter degradation."</p>

<p>Catherine thought of the spring night, in
which such holy preparations for joy were silently
being carried on, of all the youthful things just
coming into life. An inspiration came to her.
She caught her husband's hand and drew him to
the window.</p>

<p>"Pull up the blind, Mark," she said.</p>

<p>He obeyed, smiling at her as if in wonder at
this freak.</p>

<p>"Now open the window."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. There! What next?"</p>

<p>In front of the window there was a riband of
pavement protected by an overhanging section
of roof. Catherine stepped out on this pavement.
Mark followed her. They stood together facing
the spring night. There was no moon, but the
sky was clear and starlit. Nature seemed breathing
quietly, like a thing alive but asleep. The
surrounding woods were a dusky wall. The clearing
was a vague sea of dew. And the air was
full of that wonderful scent that all things seem
to have in spring. It is like the perfume of life,
of life that God has consecrated, of life that might
have been in Eden. It is odorous with hope. It
stings and embraces. It stirs the imagination to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
magic. It stirs the heart to tears. For it is
ineffably beautiful and expectant.</p>

<p>"How delicious!" Mark said.</p>

<p>Catherine's hand tightened on his arm.</p>

<p>"The trees are talking," he said. "That damp
scent comes from their roots, and the flowers and
grasses round them."</p>

<p>He drew in his breath with a gasp of pleasure.</p>

<p>"Yes?" Catherine said.</p>

<p>He bent down and touched the lawn with his
hand.</p>

<p>"What a dew! Look, Kitty, there goes a rabbit!"</p>

<p>A hunched shadow suddenly flattened and
vanished.</p>

<p>"Little beggar! He's gone into the wood.
What a jolly time he and his relations must have."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mark. Isn't the night happy, and the
spring?"</p>

<p>He drew in his breath again.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Mark!"</p>

<p>"Well, dear?"</p>

<p>"Mark&mdash;don't write this book."</p>

<p>Mark started slightly with surprise.</p>

<p>"Kitty! what are you saying?"</p>

<p>"Write a happy book."</p>

<p>"My dear babe&mdash;how uninteresting!"</p>

<p>"Write a good book, a book to make people
better and happier."</p>

<p>"A book with a purpose! No, Kitty."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well then, a spring book. This night isn't a
night with a purpose, because it's lovely."</p>

<p>He laughed quite gaily.</p>

<p>"Humorist! Why did you bring me out into
it?"</p>

<p>"To influence you against that book."</p>

<p>He was silent.</p>

<p>"Are you angry, Mark?"</p>

<p>"No, dear."</p>

<p>"Will you do what I ask?"</p>

<p>"No, Kitty."</p>

<p>He spoke very quietly and gently, then
changed the subject, talked of the coming summer,
the garden, prospective pleasures. But he
talked no more of his work. Next day he shut
himself up in his study, and thenceforward his
life became a repetition of his life during the
previous summer. A fortnight later Frederic
Berrand arrived.</p>

<p>Catherine had long felt an eager desire to see
this one intimate friend of Mark's. She expected
him to be no ordinary man, and she was not mistaken.
Berrand was much older than Mark. He
looked about forty. He was thin, sallow, eager
in manner, with shining eyes&mdash;almost toad-like&mdash;a
yellowish-white complexion, and coal-black
hair. His vivacity was un-English, yet at the
back of his nature there lay surely a stagnant
reservoir of melancholy. He was a pessimist, full
of ardour. He revelled, intellectually, in the sorrows
and in the evils that afflict the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>It was easy to see that he had a great influence
over Mark. And it was easy to see also that the
dismal genius of "William Foster" appealed to
all the peculiarities of his nature with intense
force. He was at once on friendly terms with
Catherine, to whom he spoke openly of his admiration
of her husband.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sirrett," he said one evening, when
Mark was working&mdash;he had taken to working at
night now as well as in the morning&mdash;"your husband
will do great things. He will found a
school. The young men will be captivated by
his sombre genius, and we shall have less of the
thoughtless rubbish that the journalist loves and
calls sane, healthy, and all the rest of it."</p>

<p>"But surely sanity and health&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Sirrett, we want originality and
imagination."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. But can't they be sane and
healthy?"</p>

<p>"Was Gautier healthy when he wrote of the
Priest and of the Vampire? This book Mark is
writing will be awful in its intensity. It will
make the world turn cold. It is terrible. People
will shudder at it."</p>

<p>He walked about the room enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"And its terror is the true terror&mdash;mental.
How the papers will hate it, and how every one
will read it!"</p>

<p>"May it&mdash;may it not do a great deal of harm?"
said Catherine, slowly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"What if it does? Nothing can prevent it
from being a great book."</p>

<p>And he broke out into a dissertation on art
that would have delighted Mr. Ardagh.</p>

<p>Catherine listened to him in silence, but when
he had finished she said,</p>

<p>"But you are one-sided, Mr. Berrand."</p>

<p>"I!" he cried. "How so?"</p>

<p>"You see only the horrible in life, even in love.
You care only for the horrible in art."</p>

<p>"The truth is more often horrible than not,"
he answered. "We dress it in pink paper as we
dress a burning lamp. We fear its light will
hurt our weak eyes. Almost all the pretty theories
of future states, happy hunting grounds, and
so forth, almost all the fallacies of life to which
we are inclined to cling, are only pink paper
shades which we make to save ourselves from
blinking at the light."</p>

<p>"You call it light?" she said.</p>

<p>And she felt a profound pity for him. There
was no need of that. Berrand was one of those
strange men who are happy in the contemplation
of misery.</p>

<p>While Berrand was staying with the Sirretts,
Mrs. Ardagh came to them on a visit. She was
now in very poor health, and her mind was
greatly set, in consequence, on that other world
of which the healthy scarcely think, unless they
wake at night or lose a near relation unexpectedly.
Mr. Berrand immediately horrified her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Of course he did not speak of "William Foster."
"William Foster's" existence in the house was a
secret. But he freely aired his sentiments on all
other subjects, and each sentiment went like a
sword through Mrs. Ardagh's soul.</p>

<p>"How can Mark make a friend of such a man,"
she said to Catherine. "Like your father, he
has no religious belief. He worships art instead
of God. He loves, he positively loves, the evil
of the world. Such men are a curse. They go
to people hell."</p>

<p>Her feverish eyes glowed with fanaticism.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother!" said Catherine, thinking of
"William Foster."</p>

<p>"They do not care to do good, they do not
fear to do harm," continued Mrs. Ardagh.
"Why are they not cut off?"</p>

<p>She made her daughter kneel down with her
and pray against such men.</p>

<p>Then they went down to dinner, and dined
with "William Foster."</p>

<p>Catherine felt like one in a fever. She knew
that her mother had an exaggerated mind. Nevertheless,
she was deeply moved by it, recognising
that it exaggerated truth, not a lie.</p>

<p>At dinner Mrs. Ardagh, by some ill-chance,
was led to mention "William Foster's" book.
Mark raised gay eyebrows at Berrand and Catherine
grew hot. For Mrs. Ardagh denounced the
author as she had denounced him in London, but
with more excitement.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"I trust," she said, "that he will never live to
write another."</p>

<p>Catherine felt as if a knife were thrust into her
breast, and even Mark started slightly and looked
almost uneasy, as if he fancied that the force of
Mrs. Ardagh's desire might accomplish its fulfilment.
Only Berrand was undismayed. There
was a devil of mischief in him. His eyes of
a toad gleamed as he said, turning to Mrs. Ardagh,</p>

<p>"I happen to know that 'William Foster' is
writing another book at this very time."</p>

<p>Catherine bent her eyes on her plate. She was
tingling with nervous excitement.</p>

<p>"Do you know him, then?" said Mrs. Ardagh,
in her fervid, and yet dreary, voice.</p>

<p>"Slightly."</p>

<p>"Then tell him of the dreadful harm he has
done."</p>

<p>"What harm?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ardagh spoke of Jenny Levita. It seemed
that she had now fallen into an evil way of life.</p>

<p>"But why should you attribute the folly of a
weak girl to William Foster's influence?" said
Berrand.</p>

<p>"Her soul was trembling in the balance," said
Mrs. Ardagh, striking her thin hand excitedly on
the table. "That book turned the scale. She
went down. Tell him of her, Mr. Berrand, tell
him of the ruin of that poor child. It may influence
him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," said Berrand, with a glance
at Mark. "William Foster is an artist."</p>

<p>"It is terrible that he should be permitted to
work such evil," said Mrs. Ardagh.</p>

<p>During that summer a vague and hollow darkness
seemed to brood round the life of Catherine.
It stood behind the glory of the golden
days. She felt night even at noontide, and a
damp mist floated mysteriously to her out of
the very heart of the sun. Yet she had some
happy, or at least some feverishly excited, moments,
for Berrand was generally staying with
them, and Catherine&mdash;abnormally sensitive as she
always was to her undoing,&mdash;came under his
curious influence and caught some of his enthusiasm
for the talent of "William Foster."</p>

<p>Once again Mark began to speak to her of his
work, to read parts of it aloud to both his companions.
And there were evenings when Catherine,
carried away by the intellectual joy of the
two men, exulted with them in the horrible fascination
of the book and in the intensity of its
dramatic force. But, when these moments were
over, and she was gone, she brooded darkly over
her mother's words. For she knew that the
book was evil. Like a snake it carried poison
with it, and, presently, it was going to carry that
poison out from this house in the woods, out
into the world. Ah! the poor world, on which
a thousand things preyed, in which a thousand
snakes set their poisoned fangs!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>And then she wept. Mark and Berrand were
eagerly talking of the snake, praising its lustrous
skin, marvelling at its jewelled eyes, foretelling
its lithe progress through Society. She heard the
murmur of their voices until far into the night.
And sometimes she thought that distant murmur
sounded like the hum of evil, or like the furtive
whisper of conspirators.</p>

<p>Berrand did not leave them until the new book
was nearly finished. As he pressed Catherine's
hand in farewell he said,</p>

<p>"You will have a sensational autumn, Mrs.
Sirrett."</p>

<p>"Sensational. Why?" she asked.</p>

<p>"London will ring with William Foster's name.
My word how the Journalists will curse! They
protect the morality of the nation you know&mdash;on
paper."</p>

<p>He was gone. As the carriage drove away
Catherine saw his beautiful, and yet rather dreadful,
eyes gleaming with mischievous excitement.
Suddenly she felt heavy-hearted. Those last
words of his cleared away any mist of doubt that
lingered about her own terror. She recognised
fully for the first time the essential difference
between Mark and Berrand. Mark was really
possessed by the spirit of the artist, was driven
by something strange and dominating within him
to do what he did. Berrand was possessed by a
spirit of mischievous devilry, by the poor and
degrading desire to shock and startle the world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
at whatever cost. For the moment Catherine
mentally saw Mark in a light of nobility; Berrand
in a darkness of degradation.</p>

<p>Yet&mdash;this thought followed in a moment,&mdash;Berrand
was harmless to the world, while Mark&mdash;</p>

<p>"Kitty, come in here," called her husband's
voice from the study. "I want to consult you
about this last chapter."</p>

<p>In the Autumn "William Foster's" new book
was issued by an "advanced" publisher, who loved
to hear his wares called dangerous, and who
walked on air when the reviewers said that such
men as he were a curse to Society&mdash;as they occasionally
did when there was nothing special to
write about.</p>

<p>In the autumn also Mrs. Ardagh's illness grew
worse and it appeared that she could not live
much longer. Catherine was terribly grieved, and
was for a time so much engaged with her mother
that she scarcely heeded what was going on in
the world around. Incessantly immured in the
sick-room she did not trace the progress of the
snake through Society until&mdash;as Berrand had
foretold&mdash;the cries of the Journalists rose to
Heaven like cries from a burning city. "William
Foster" was held up to execration so universal
that his book could hardly be printed in
sufficient quantities to satisfy the demands of a
public frantically eager to be harmed. In her
sick-room Mrs. Ardagh, now not far from death,
yet still religiously interested in the well-being of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the world she was leaving, heard the echoes of
the journalistic cries. Some friend, perhaps, conveyed
them. For Catherine was silent on the
matter, keeping a silence of fear and of shame.
And these echoes stayed with the dying woman,
as stay the voices in the hills.</p>

<p>One night, when Catherine came into her
mother's room, Mrs. Ardagh was crying feebly.
On the sheet of the bed lay a letter which she
had crumpled in her pale hands and then tried,
vainly, to fling away from her. Catherine leaned
over the bed.</p>

<p>"What is it, mother?" she said. "You are
not in pain?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ardagh shifted in the bed. There was a
suggestion of almost intolerable uneasiness in the
movement.</p>

<p>"I am in pain, horrible pain," she answered.
"No&mdash;no," as Catherine was about to ring for
the nurse, "not in the body&mdash;not that."</p>

<p>Catherine sat down by the bed and clasped her
mother's hot hand.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she whispered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ardagh was silent for a moment. She
blinked her heavy eyelids to stop the tears from
falling on her wasted cheeks. At length she
said,</p>

<p>"William Foster has done more evil."</p>

<p>Catherine did not speak. Her heart beat irregularly,
and then seemed to stop, and then beat
with unnatural force again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"Catherine," her mother continued, "Jenny is
utterly lost."</p>

<p>"No, mother, no!" Catherine said. "I will go
to her. Let me go. I will rescue her. I will
make her see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush&mdash;you can't. She is dead and she died
in shame."</p>

<p>She paused. Catherine did not speak.</p>

<p>"And now," Mrs. Ardagh continued feebly,
"that man is spreading the net for others. Do
you know, Catherine, I often pray for him?"</p>

<p>"Do you, mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He has great powers. I never let your
father know it, but that first book of his made an
impression upon me that has never faded. That's
why I think of him even now&mdash;that and the fate
of poor Jenny."</p>

<p>She lifted herself up a little in the bed.</p>

<p>"His last book, I am told, is much more terrible,
much more deadly than the first."</p>

<p>"Is it?"</p>

<p>"You haven't read it?"</p>

<p>Catherine hesitated a moment, then she said,</p>

<p>"I know something about it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ardagh lay still for a while, as if thinking.
Presently she said,</p>

<p>"Catherine, such an odd, foolish idea keeps
coming to me."</p>

<p>"What is it, mother?"</p>

<p>"That I should like to see 'William Foster'
and&mdash;and try to make him understand what he is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
doing. Perhaps he doesn't know, doesn't realise.
God often lets the devil blind us, you know. If
I told him about Jenny, told him all about her, he
might see&mdash;he might understand. Don't you
think so?"</p>

<p>Catherine was holding her mother's hand. She
pressed it vehemently.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, perhaps he might!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ardagh sat up still more among her pillows.</p>

<p>"You don't think it's a silly fancy?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I wonder."</p>

<p>Catherine was crying quietly.</p>

<p>"It keeps coming," said Mrs. Ardagh, "as if
God sent it to me. What can I do? How can
I send to William Foster? I don't know where
he is. Could that Mr. Berrand&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Mother," Catherine said. "Leave it to me,
I will bring William Foster to you."</p>

<p>She was trembling. But the invalid, exhausted
with the excitement of the conversation, was
growing drowsy. She sank down again in her
pillows.</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured. "I&mdash;might&mdash;tell&mdash;him&mdash;William
Foster."</p>

<p>She slept heavily.</p>

<p>"Mark," Catherine said to her husband the
next day. "Mother is dying. She can only live
a very few days."</p>

<p>"Oh, Kitty! How grieved I am!"</p>

<p>His face was full of the most tender sympathy.
He took her hand gently and kissed her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"My Kitty, how will you bear this great sorrow?"</p>

<p>"Mark," Catherine said, and her voice sounded
curiously strained. "Mother wants very much
to see you, before she dies. She has something
to say to you. I think she cares more about
seeing you than about anything else in the
world."</p>

<p>Mark looked surprised.</p>

<p>"I will go to her at once," he said. "What
can it be? Ah, it must be something about you."</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"She will tell you, Mark. It is better she
should tell you herself."</p>

<p>"I will go to her then. I will go now."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment"&mdash;Catherine was very pale&mdash;"Promise
me, Mark, that you won't&mdash;you
won't be angry if&mdash;if mother&mdash;you will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped. Her emotion was painful.
Mark was more and more puzzled.</p>

<p>"Angry with your mother? At such a time!"
he said.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;you wouldn't. I am upset. I am foolish.
Let me go first to tell her you are coming.
Follow me in a few minutes."</p>

<p>She went out leaving her husband amazed.
When she arrived in Eaton Square Mr. Ardagh
met her in the hall.</p>

<p>"She is worse," he said. "Much worse. The
end cannot be far off."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"The beginning," Catherine said, looking him
straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>He understood then which parental spirit had
conquered the spirit of the child, and he smiled&mdash;sadly
or gladly? He hardly knew. So strangely
does death play with us all. Catherine went
upstairs into her mother's room, which was dim
and very hot. She shut the door, sent away the
nurse, and went up to the bedside.</p>

<p>"Mother," she said, "William Foster is coming.
Do you feel that you can see him?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ardagh was perfectly conscious, although
so near death.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "God means me to give him
a message&mdash;God means me."</p>

<p>She lay silent; Catherine sat by her. Presently
she spoke again.</p>

<p>"I shall convince him," she said quietly.
"That is meant. If I did not God would strike
him down. He would be cut off. But I shall
make him know himself."</p>

<p>And then she repeated, with a sort of feeble
but intense conviction,</p>

<p>"If I did not God would strike him down&mdash;yes&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>Something&mdash;perhaps the fact that her mother
was so near death, so close to that great secret,&mdash;made
her words, faltering though they were, go
home to Catherine with the most extraordinary
poignancy, as words had never gone before. She
felt that it was true, that there was no alternative.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Either Mark must be convinced now, by this
bedside, in this hot, dark room from which a soul
was passing, or he would, by some accident, by
some sudden means, be swept away from the
world that he was injuring, that he was poisoning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ardagh seemed to grow more feeble with
every moment that passed. And suddenly a
great fear overtook Catherine, the dread that
Mark would come too late, and then&mdash;God's other
means! She trembled, and strained her ears to
catch the sound of wheels. Mrs. Ardagh now
seemed to be sinking into sleep&mdash;Catherine strove
to rouse her. She stirred and said, "What is
it?" in a voice that sounded peevish.</p>

<p>Just then there was a gentle tap on the door.
Catherine sprang up, and hastened to it with a
fast beating heart. Mr. Ardagh stood there.</p>

<p>"How is she?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"I think she is not in pain. She is just resting.
Has Mark come?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Please send him up directly he comes."</p>

<p>She spoke with a hushed, but with an intense,
excitement.</p>

<p>"I want him to&mdash;to say good-bye to her," she
added.</p>

<p>Mr. Ardagh nodded, and went softly downstairs.</p>

<p>"Is that he&mdash;is that William Foster?" said
Mrs. Ardagh feebly from the bed.</p>

<p>"No, mother. But he will be here directly."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm very tired," said the sick woman in reply.
And again her thin voice sounded irritable.</p>

<p>Catherine sat down by her and held her hand
tightly, as if that grasp could keep her in this
life. A few minutes passed. Then there was
the sound of a cab in the Square. It ceased in
front of the house. Catherine could scarcely
breathe. She bent down to the dying woman.</p>

<p>"Mother!"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Mother, he has come&mdash;but I want to tell you
something&mdash;are you listening?"</p>

<p>"Move the pillow."</p>

<p>Catherine did so.</p>

<p>"Mother, I want to tell you. William Foster is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The bedroom door opened and Mark entered
softly. Catherine stood up, still holding her
mother's hand, which was now very cold. Mark
came to the bed on tiptoe.</p>

<p>"Mother," Catherine said, "William Foster"&mdash;Mark
started&mdash;"is here. Tell him&mdash;tell
him."</p>

<p>There was no reply from the bed.</p>

<p>"Kitty," Mark whispered, "what is this?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" she said. "Mother&mdash;mother, don't
you hear me?"</p>

<p>Again there was no reply. Then Catherine
bent down and cast a hard, staring glance of enquiry
on her mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ardagh was dead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Catherine looked up at Mark.</p>

<p>"God's other means," she thought.</p>

<hr class="hr1" />

<p>The death of her mother left a strong and terrible
impression upon Catherine. She brooded
over it continually and over Mrs. Ardagh's last
words. The last words of the dying often dwell
in the memories of the living. Faltering, feeble,
sometimes apparently inconsequent, they appear
nevertheless prophetic, touched with the dignity
of Eternal truths. Lives have been moulded by
such last words. Natures have been diverted into
new and curious paths. So it was now. For the
future Mr. Ardagh's influence had no force over
his daughter. An influence from the grave dominated
her. Mr. Ardagh recognised the fact,
shrugged his shoulders and travelled. His philosophy
taught him to accept the inevitable with
the fortitude of the Stoic. From henceforward the
Sirretts saw little of him. As to Mark, with his
habitual tenderness he set about consoling his
wife for her loss. He was kindness itself. Catherine
seemed grateful, was indeed grateful to him.
Nevertheless, after the death of Mrs. Ardagh,
something seemed to stand between her and her
husband, dividing them. Mark did not know what
this was. For some time he was unconscious of
this thin veil dropped between them. Even when
he became aware of it he could not tell why it
was there. He strove to put it aside, but in vain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Then he strove not to see it, not to think of it.
He forgot it in his work. But Catherine always
knew what set her apart from her husband. It
was that influence from the grave. It was the
memory of her mother's last words. She recognised
them from the first, blindly, as words of
prophecy. Yet the days went by. "William
Foster" sat in his study in the Surrey home once
more, while the spring grew, imitative of last
year's spring. And there was no sign from God.
Catherine never doubted that the dying woman
had been inspired. She never doubted that "William
Foster" would be stayed, however tragically,
from working fresh evil in the world. Indeed she
waited, as one assured of some particular future,
breathless in expectation of its approach. Sometimes
she strove to picture precisely what it might
be, and, fancifully, she set two men before her&mdash;Mark
and "William Foster." Even in real life
they seemed two different men. Why not in the
life of the imagination? And that was sweeter,
for then she could look forward to the one standing
fast, to the other being stricken. Might not
his genius die in a man while the man lived on?
There had been instances of men who had written
one or two brilliant books and had seemed to
exhaust themselves in that effort. And she
dreamed of her husband's gift being stolen from
him&mdash;divinely&mdash;of the stranger being slain. Yet
this dreaming was idle and fantastic, the image
which greets closed eyes. For Mark's energy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and enthusiasm were growing. The fury of the
papers fed him. The cries of pious fear emboldened
his dogged and dreary talent. His genius
grew darker as its darkness became recognised.</p>

<p>This third book of his promised to be more
powerful, more deadly, than either of its forerunners.
He did not speak much of it to Catherine.
But now and then, carried away by excitement
and by the need of sympathy, he dropped
a hint of what he was doing. She listened attentively
but said little. Mark noticed her lack of
responsiveness, and one night he said rather
bitterly,</p>

<p>"You no longer care for your husband's
achievements, Catherine."</p>

<p>He did not call her Kitty.</p>

<p>"I fear them, Mark," Catherine replied.</p>

<p>"Fear them! Why?"</p>

<p>"They are doing great harm in the world."</p>

<p>Mark uttered an impatient exclamation. As a
man he was kind and gentle, but as an artist he
was wilful and intolerant. Soon after this he
wrote to Berrand and invited him to stay. Berrand
came. This time Catherine shuddered at
his coming. She began to look upon him as her
husband's evil genius. Berrand did not apparently
notice any change in her, for he treated
her as usual, and spoke much to her of Mark.
And Catherine was too reserved to express the
feelings which tortured her to a comparative
stranger. For this reason Berrand did not understand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the terrible conflict that was raging
within her as "William Foster's" new work
grew, and he often spoke to her about the book,
and described, with mischievous intellectual delight,
its terror, its immorality and its pain.
Catherine listened with apparent calm. She was
waiting for that interruption from heaven. She
was wondering why it did not come.</p>

<p>One night in summer it chanced that she and
Berrand spoke of Fate. Catherine, dominated
by her fixed idea that God would intervene in
some strange and abrupt way to interrupt the
activities of Mark, spoke of Fate as something inevitably
ordained, certain as the rising of the sun
or the dropping down of the darkness. Berrand
laughed.</p>

<p>"There is no Fate," he said. "There is man,
there is woman. Man and woman make circumstance.
We fashion our own lives and the lives
of others."</p>

<p>"And our deaths?" said Catherine.</p>

<p>"We die when we've done enough, when we've
done our best or worst, when we've pushed our
energy as far as it will go&mdash;that is, if we die what
is called a natural death. But of course now and
then some other human being chooses to think
for us, and to think we have lived long enough
or too long. And then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused with a smile.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;&mdash;?" said Catherine, leaning slightly
forward.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then that human being may cut our thread
prematurely, and down we go to death."</p>

<p>Catherine drew in her breath sharply.</p>

<p>"But that again," continued Berrand. "Is
man&mdash;or woman&mdash;not the fantasy you call
Fate?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps Fate can take possession of a man or
a woman," Catherine said slowly and thoughtfully,
"govern them, act through them."</p>

<p>"That's a dangerous doctrine. You believe
that criminals are irresponsible then?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said. "I suppose there
must be an agent. Yes, I suppose there must."</p>

<p>She spoke as one who is thinking out a
problem.</p>

<p>"God," she continued, after a moment of silence,
"may choose to use a man or woman as an
agent instead of a disease."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Berrand, with his odd, high
laugh, "I cannot go with you on that road of
thought, Mrs. Sirrett. I am not afflicted with a
religion. Oh, here's Mark. How have you been
getting on, Mr. William Foster?"</p>

<p>"Grandly," he replied.</p>

<p>His dark eyes were blazing with excitement.
Catherine suddenly turned very cold. She got
up and left the room. The two men scarcely
noticed her departure. They plunged into an
eager discussion on the book. They debated it
till the night waned and the melancholy breath
of dawn stole in at the open window.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Catherine, who had gone to bed,
lay awake. This summer was so like last summer.
Now, as then, she was sleepless, and heard
the distant, excited voices rising and falling,
murmuring on and on hour after hour. Now, as
then, they accompanied activity. Now, as then,
the activity was deadly, harmful to an invisible
multitude, hidden out in the great world. But
there was a difference between last year and this,
so like in many ways. Mark's power had grown
in the interval. He had become more dangerous.
And Catherine had developed also. Circumstance&mdash;spoken
of by Berrand&mdash;had changed,
twisted into a different shape by dying hands,
twisted again by the hands&mdash;all unconscious&mdash;of
that man who talked downstairs, of Berrand.
Was he, too, an agent of Fate, at which he scornfully
laughed? Why not?</p>

<p>Oh, those everlasting voices! they rang hatefully
in the sleepless woman's ears. Their eagerness,
their enthusiasm, were terrible to her. For
now their joy seemed to summon her to a great
darkness. Their sound seemed to call her to the
making of a great silence. She put her hands
over her ears, but she still heard them till it was
dawn. She still heard them when they were no
more speaking.</p>

<p>From this time Catherine waited indeed, but
with a patience quite different from that which
possessed her formerly. Then she was expectant,
almost superstitiously expectant, of an abrupt interposition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of Fate. Now she waited, but with
less expectancy, and with a strange and growing
sense of personal obligation which had been
totally absent from her before the issue lay between
the thing invisible and herself. And each
day that passed brought the issue a step nearer
to her. How pathetical seemed to her the ignorance
of the two men who were her companions
in the cloistered house at this time. Tears
rose in her eyes at the thought of her secret and
their impotence to know it. But then she thought
of her mother's death-bed and the tears ran dry.
For the spirit of her mother surely was with her
in the dark, the spirit that knew all now and that
could inspire and direct her.</p>

<p>The book grew and Catherine waited. Would
Mark be allowed to complete it? that was the
great question. If he was, then the burden of
action was laid upon her by the will of God. She
had quite made up her mind on that. She had
even prayed, and believed that an answer had
been given to her prayer, and that the answer
was&mdash;"In the event you anticipate it is God's will
that you should act." She was fully resolved to
do God's will. And so she waited, with a strong,
but how anxious, patience. The growth of the
book was now become ironical to her as the
growth of a plant which must die when it attains
a certain height; the labour spent upon it, the
discussion that raged around it, the decisions
that were arrived at as to its course&mdash;all these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
things were now most pitifully pathetic to Catherine.
As she watched Mark and Berrand, as she
listened to them, she seemed to watch and listen
to children, playing idly, chattering idly, on the
edge of events that must stop their play, their
chatter&mdash;perhaps for ever.</p>

<p>For this book would never see the light. No
one would ever read it. No one would ever speak
of it but these two men, whose lives seemed
bound up in it. And Catherine alone knew this.</p>

<p>Sometimes she had a longing to tell them of
this knowledge, to say to Mark, "Do not waste
yourself in this useless energy!" to say to Berrand,
"Do not rejoice over the future of that
which has no future." But she refrained, knowing
that to speak would be to give the lie to what
she spoke. For such revelation must frustrate
her contemplated action. So nobody knew what
she knew, except the spirit that stood by her in
the night. She waited, and the book drew slowly
towards its climax and its close. As Berrand
grew more excited about it he spoke more of it
to Catherine. But Mark&mdash;conscious of that veil
dropped between him and his wife&mdash;scarcely
mentioned it to her, and declined to read any
passages from it aloud. Catherine understood
that he distrusted her and knew her utterly unsympathetic
and adverse to his labours. The sign
for which she had hoped, which she had once
most confidently expected, did not come. And
at length she almost ceased to think of it, and was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
inclined to put the idea from her as a foolish
dream.</p>

<p>The burden of action was, it seemed, to be laid
upon her. She would accept it calmly, dutifully.
So the summer waned, drawing towards autumn.
The atmosphere grew heavy and mellow. The
garden was languid with its weight of bearing
plants and with its fruits. Mists rose at evening
in the woods, clouding the trunks of the trees,
and spreading melancholy as a sad tale that floats,
like a mist, over those who hear it. And, one
day, the book was finished.</p>

<p>Berrand came to tell Catherine. He was radiant.
While he spoke he never noticed that she
closed her hands tightly as one who prepares to
face an enemy.</p>

<p>"We are going to London this afternoon," he
added. "Mark must see his publisher."</p>

<p>"He is taking up the manuscript?" said
Catherine hastily.</p>

<p>"No, no. There are one or two finishing
touches to be put. But he must arrange about
the date of publishing. He will return by the
midnight train, but I shall stay in town for the
night."</p>

<p>Mark locked up the manuscript in a drawer of
his writing table, the key of which he carried
about him on a chain. And the two men took
their departure, leaving Catherine alone.</p>

<p>So the time of her duty was fully come. She
had waited till now, because, till now, she had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
been absolutely sure that she was to be the agent
through whom Fate was to work. But she could
no longer dare to doubt. The book was finished.
Mark had been allowed to finish it. But its
deadly work was not accomplished till it was
given to the world. It must never be given to
the world.</p>

<p>The day was not cold. Yet Catherine ordered
the footman to light a fire in Mark's study.
When he had done so she told him not to allow
her to be disturbed. Then she went into the
room and shut the door behind her. She walked
up to the writing table, at which Mark had spent
so many hours, labouring, thinking, imagining,
working out, fashioning that shell which was to
burst and maim a world. The silence in the
room seemed curiously intense. The fire gleamed,
and the sun gleamed too; though already it was
slanting to the West. Catherine stood for some
time by the table. Then she tried the drawer
in which Mark kept his manuscript and found
it locked. The resistance of the drawer to her
hand roused her.</p>

<p>Two or three minutes later one of the maids in
the servant's hall said,</p>

<p>"Whatever's that?"</p>

<p>"What?" said the footman who had lit the
study fire.</p>

<p>"Listen!" said the maid.</p>

<p>They listened and heard a sound like a blow
struck on some hard substance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"There it is again," said the maid. "What
ever can it be?"</p>

<p>The footman didn't know, but they both agreed
that the noise seemed to come from the study.
While they were still gossiping about it Catherine
stood at Mark's writing table, and drew out from
an open drawer the manuscript of the book. She
lifted it in her hands slowly and her face was hard
and set. Then she turned and carried it to the
hearth, where the fire was blazing. By the hearth
she paused. She meant to destroy the book in
the fire. But now that she saw the book, now
that she held it in her hands, the deed seemed so
horribly merciless that she hesitated. Then she
knelt down on the hearth and leaned towards
the flames. Their light played upon her face,
their heat scorched her skin. She held the book
towards them, over them. The flames flew up
towards it eagerly, seeming to desire it. Catherine
tantalised them by withholding from them their
prey. For now, in this crisis of action, doubts
assailed her. She remembered that she had
never read the book, though she had heard much
of it from Berrand. He was imaginative and essentially
mischievous. Perhaps he had exaggerated
its tendency, drawn too lurid a picture of
its horrible power. Catherine turned a page or
two and glanced at the clear, even writing. It
fascinated her eyes.</p>

<p>At eight the footman opened the door, announcing
dinner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Catherine started as if from a dream. Her face
was white and her eyes were ablaze with excitement.
She put the manuscript back in the
drawer, went into the dining-room and made a
pretence of dining. But very soon she was back
again in the study. She sat down under a lamp
by the fire and went on reading the book. She
knew that Mark would not be home till midnight;
there was plenty of time. She turned the leaves
one by one, and presently she forgot the passing
of time, she forgot everything in the evil fascination
of the book. She was enthralled. She was
horror-stricken. But she could not cease from
reading. Only when she had finished she meant
to burn the book. No one else should ever come
under its spell. She never heard the clock striking
the hours. She never heard the sound of
carriage wheels on the gravel of the drive. She
never heard a step in the hall, the opening of the
study door. Only when Mark stood before her
with an exclamation of keen surprise did she start
up. The manuscript dropped from her hands on
to the hearth. The drawer in the writing table,
broken open, gaped wide.</p>

<p>"Catherine," Mark said, and he bent hastily
and picked up the book. "Catherine, what is the
meaning of this? You have&mdash;you have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, struck dumb by flooding astonishment.
She stared up at him without a word and
with a dazed expression in her eyes. He looked
towards the drawer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have dared to break open my writing
table!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, finding a voice. "I have
dared."</p>

<p>"And to read&mdash;to read&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She nodded. Mark seemed utterly confused
by surprise. He looked almost sheepish, as men
do in blank amazement. She got up and stood
before him and laid her hands on his, which held
the book.</p>

<p>"You see that fire?" she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>He looked at it, as if he had not noticed it before.</p>

<p>"What's it for?" he said, also in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Don't you know?"</p>

<p>They looked into each other's eyes for a moment.</p>

<p>"To&mdash;to&mdash;you intended to burn&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She nodded again, and closed her hands tightly
on the book.</p>

<p>"Mark," she said solemnly. "It's an evil
thing. Let it go."</p>

<p>His face changed. Astonishment died in
fierce excitement.</p>

<p>"You're mad!" he said brutally.</p>

<p>And he struck her hands away from the book
with his clenched fist. She did not cry out, but
her face became utterly dogged. He saw that.</p>

<p>"D'you hear me?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>His passion rose, as he began fully to grasp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the enormity of the deed that his coming had
prevented.</p>

<p>"You would destroy my labour, my very soul,"
he said hoarsely. "You who pretended to love
me!"</p>

<p>"Because I love you," she said.</p>

<p>He laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"You hate me," he cried.</p>

<p>"I hate to see you do evil," she said.</p>

<p>"This is fanaticism," he muttered, looking
at her obstinate white face, and steady eyes.
"Sheer fanaticism."</p>

<p>It began almost to frighten him.</p>

<p>"You shall not do this evil," she said. "You
shall not."</p>

<p>Mark stared at her for a moment. Then he
turned away.</p>

<p>"I'll not argue with you," he said. "But, if
you had done what you meant to do, if you had
destroyed my labour, I would have recreated it,
every sentence, every word."</p>

<p>"No, Mark!"</p>

<p>"I would, I would," he said. "The world
shall have it, the world should have had it even
then. Go to your room."</p>

<p>She left him. But her face had not changed
or lost its expression.</p>

<p>She went upstairs slowly. And the spirit of
her mother went with her. She felt sure of that.</p>

<hr class="hr1" />

<p>When two days afterwards, late in the evening,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Mark Sirrett suddenly died,&mdash;from poison, as
was proved at Catherine's trial&mdash;she had no feeling
that Mark was dead. That only came to her
afterwards, as she sat by the body, awaiting the
useless arrival of the doctor. She only knew
that the stranger was gone, the stranger into
whose wild eyes she had gazed for the first time
in the Pavilion of Granada, when the world was
golden beneath them and the roses touched his
hair. She looked at the body, and she seemed
to hear again the bell of the cathedral, filling the
drowsy valley with terrible vibrations of romance.
It was a passing bell. For God had stricken
down "William Foster."</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE CRY OF THE CHILD.</h2>

<h3>PART I.<br />
THE DEAD CHILD.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> peasants going homeward at evening,
when the last sunbeams slanted over the mountains
and struck the ruffled surface of the river,
did not hear the cry. The children, picking
violets and primroses in the hedgerow by the
small white house, did not hear it. The occasional
tourists who trudged sturdily onward to
the rugged pass at the head of the valley did not
hear it.</p>

<p>Only Maurice Dale heard it, and grew white
and shivered.</p>

<p>Even to him it had been at first as faint as an
echo pulsing through a dream. He had said to
himself that it was a fancy of his brain. And
then he had pulled himself together and listened.
And again, as if from very far off, the little cry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
had stolen to his ear and faded away. Then he
had said to himself that it was the night wind
caught in some cranny of the house, and striving
to get free. He had thrown open his window
and leaned out, and trembled, when he found
that the hot night was breathless, airless, that no
leaf danced in the elm that shaded his study,
that the ivy climbing beneath the sill did not stir
as he gazed down at it with straining eyes.</p>

<p>It was not the cry of the wind then. Yet it
must be. Or if not that it must be some voice
of nature. But the river had no such thrill of
pain, of reproach in its song. Then he thought
it was some night bird, haunting the eaves of his
cottage, or the tangle of wood the country people
called his garden. And he put on his clothes
eagerly, descended the narrow staircase, and let
himself out on to the path that curved to the
white gate. But, in the garden there was no
sound of birds.</p>

<p>This was a year ago. Maurice remembered
very well his long vigil in the garden, and how
he had prayed that he might hear one note, one
only, of a night-jar, or the hoot of an owl in the
forest, so that the black thought just born in
his mind might be strangled, and the shadow
driven out of his heart. But his prayer had not
been granted. And he knew he had not deserved
that it should be. Towards dawn he went back
into his house again, and on the threshold, just as
a pallor glimmered up as if out of the grass at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
his feet, he heard the cry again. And he knew
that it came from within the house.</p>

<p>Then the sweat stood on his forehead, and he
said to himself, with pale lips, "It is the cry of
the child!"</p>

<p>All the people of Brayfield by the sea were
agreed on one point. The new doctor, Maurice
Dale, young as he looked, was clever. He had
done wonders for Mrs. Bird, the rich old lady at
Ocean View. He had performed a quite brilliant
amputation on Tommy Lyne, the poor little boy
who had been run down by a demon bicyclist.
And then he was well born. It got about that
his father was an Honourable, and all the young
ladies of Brayfield trembled at the thought that
he was a bachelor. His looks were also in his
favour. Maurice was pale and tall, with black,
smooth hair parted in the middle, regular features,
and large black eyes. The expression he assumed
suited him. It was curiously sad. But,
at first, this apparent pathos was a great success
in Brayfield. It was only at a later period that
it was the cause of unkind tittle-tattle. In the
beginning of Maurice's residence at Brayfield
eulogy attended it and applause was never far
off. People said that Maurice was impressionable,
and that the vision of pain upon which the
medical student's eyes must look so closely had
robbed him of the natural buoyancy of youth.
Poor young man, they thought enthusiastically,
he suffers with those who suffer. And this was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
considered&mdash;and rightly considered&mdash;a very touching
trait in Maurice.</p>

<p>Brayfield was well satisfied with its new doctor,
and set itself to be ill for his benefit with a fine
perseverance. But, as time went on, the satisfaction
of Brayfield became mingled with curiosity.
The new doctor was almost too melancholy. It
would not be true to say that he never smiled,
but his smile was even sadder than his gravity.
There was a chill in it, as there is a chill in the
first light of dawn. One or two particularly impressionable
people declared that it frightened
them, that it was uncanny. This idea, once
started, developed. It went from house to
house. And so, gradually, a spirit of whispering
awe arose in the little town, and the vision
of human pain ceased to be altogether accountable
for the pale sorrow of the young doctor. It
was decided that his habitual depression must take
its rise from some more personal cause, and, upon
this decision, gossip naturally ran a wild course.
Since nobody knew anything about Maurice Dale
except that his father was an Honourable, rumour
had plenty of elbow-room. It took advantage of
the situation, and Maurice was more talked about
than anybody in Brayfield. And Lily Alston,
the daughter of Canon Alston, Rector of Brayfield,
launched out into surmises which, however,
she kept to herself.</p>

<p>Lily, at this time, was a curious mixture of
romance and religion, of flightiness and faith.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
She read French novels all night and went to
early service in the morning. She studied Swinburne
and taught in the Sunday-school with almost
equal ardour, and did her duty and pursued
a thousand things outside of her duty with such
enthusiasm that she was continually knocked up.
On these continual occasions Maurice Dale was
invariably sent for, and so an intimacy grew up
between him and the Rectory, which contained
the Canon, his daughter, and the servants. For
Mrs. Alston was dead, and Lily was an only child.
Real intimacy with a Rectory means, above all
things, Sunday suppers after evening church, and,
in time, it became an unalterable custom for
Maurice Dale to spend the twilight of his Sabbaths
with the Canon and his daughter. The
Canon, who was intellectual and desolate, despite
his daughter, since his wife's death, liked a talk
with Maurice; and Lily, without having fallen in
love with the young doctor, thought him, as she
said to herself, "a wonderfully interesting study."</p>

<p>Lily's wild surmises, already alluded to, were
born on one of these Sabbath evenings in winter,
when she, the Canon, and Maurice, were gathered
round the fire after supper.</p>

<p>The sea could be heard rolling upon the pebbly
beach at a distance, and the wind played about
the skirts of the darkness. The Canon, happily
at ease after his hard day's work, rested in his red
armchair puffing at his well-seasoned pipe. Lily
was lying on a big old-fashioned sofa drawn before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the flames, a Persian cat, grave in its cloud
of fur, nestling against her and singing its song of
comfort. Maurice Dale sat upright, pulling at a
cigar. It chanced that Lily had been away the
week before, paying a visit in London, and naturally
the conversation turned idly upon her doings.</p>

<p>"I used to love London," the Canon said, with
a half sigh. "In the old days, when I shocked
one or two good people here, Lily, by taking
your mother to the playhouses. Somehow I
don't care for these modern plays. I don't think
she would have liked them."</p>

<p>"I love London, too," Lily said, in her enthusiastic
voice, "but I think modern plays are intensely
interesting, especially Ibsen's."</p>

<p>"They're cruel," the Canon said.</p>

<p>"Yes, father, but not more cruel than some
of the older pieces."</p>

<p>"Such as&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking of 'The Bells.' I saw Irving
in it on Friday for the first time. You've seen
it, of course, Mr. Dale?"</p>

<p>Maurice, who had been gazing into the fire,
looked up. His lips tightened for a moment,
then he said:</p>

<p>"No, never!"</p>

<p>"What! Though you lived in London all
those years when you were a medical student?"</p>

<p>"I had opportunities of seeing it, of course, but
somehow I never took them&mdash;and I dislike the
subject of the play greatly now."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a certain vehemence in his voice.</p>

<p>"Why?" the Canon asked. "I remember my
wife was very fond of it."</p>

<p>"I think it morbid and dangerous. There are
troubles enough in life without adding to them
such a hateful notion as a&mdash;a haunting; a horrible
thing that&mdash;" he looked round with a sort of
questioning gaze in his dark eyes&mdash;"that must be
an impossibility."</p>

<p>"I don't know," the Canon said, without observing
the glance. "I don't know. A sin may
well haunt a man."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But only as a memory, not as a
jingle of bells, not as a definite noise, like a noise
a man may hear in the street any day. That
must be impossible. Now&mdash;don't you say
so?"</p>

<p>Lily, on her sofa, had noticed the very peculiar
excitement of the young doctor's manner, and
that his denial was really delivered in the form
of an ardent interrogation. But the Canon's
mind was not so alert after the strain of pulpit
oratory. He was calmly unaware of any personal
thrill in the discussion.</p>

<p>"I would not be sure," he said. "God may
have what men would call supernatural ways of
punishment as well as natural ones."</p>

<p>"I decline to believe in the supernatural,"
Maurice said, rather harshly.</p>

<p>"Granted that these bells might ring in a man's
mind, so that he believed that his ears actually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
heard them. That would be just as bad for
him."</p>

<p>"Then, I suppose, he is a madman," Lily said.</p>

<p>Maurice started round on his chair.</p>

<p>"That's a&mdash;a rather shocking presumption, isn't
it?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Well," the Canon said, knocking the ashes
slowly out of his pipe, "if you exclude the supernatural
in such a case, and come upon the natural,
I must say I think Lily is not far wrong. The
man who hears perpetually a non-existent sound
connected with some incident of his past will at
any rate soon be on the highway to insanity, I
fancy."</p>

<p>Maurice said nothing for a moment, but Lily
noticed that he looked deeply disturbed. His
lips were pressed together. His eyes shone with
excitement, and his pale forehead frowned. In
the short silence that followed on the Canon's remark,
he seemed to be thinking steadfastly. At
last he lifted up his head with a jerk and said:</p>

<p>"A man may have a strong imagination, without
being a madman, Canon. He may choose
to translate a mere memory into a sound-companion,
just as men often choose to play with
their fancies in various ways. He may elect to
say to himself, I remember vividly the cry of&mdash;"
He stopped abruptly, then went on hastily, "the
sound of bells. My mind hears them. Let me&mdash;for
my amusement&mdash;push on my imagination a
step further and see what will happen. Hark!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
It's done. My ears can hear now what a moment
ago only my mind could hear. Yes, my ears
hear it now."</p>

<p>He spoke with such conviction, and the gesture
which he linked with his words, was so dramatic,
that Lily pushed herself up on the pillows of the
sofa, and even the Canon involuntarily assumed
an attitude of keen attention.</p>

<p>"Why, Dale," the latter said after a moment,
"you should have been an actor, not a doctor.
Really you led me to anticipate bells, and I only
hear the wind. Lily, didn't you feel as I did,
eh?"</p>

<p>Lily had gone a little pale. She looked across
at Maurice.</p>

<p>"I don't know that I expected to hear bells,
father," she said slowly.</p>

<p>As she said those words, Maurice Dale, for the
first time, felt as if a human being drew very near
to his secret. Lily's glance at him asked him a
question. "What was it that pierced through
the wind so faintly?" it seemed to say.</p>

<p>"What then?" the Canon asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she replied.</p>

<p>Maurice got up.</p>

<p>"I must go now," he said.</p>

<p>The Canon protested. It was early. They
must have one more smoke. But Maurice could
not be induced to stay. As he walked rapidly
homeward in the darkness he told himself again
and again that he was a fool. How could it be?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
How could she hear the cry? The cry of the
child?</p>

<p>That night Lily did not read a French novel.
She lay awake. Her fancy was set on fire by
the evening's talk. Her girlish imagination was
kindled. In those dark and silent hours she first
began to weave a web of romance round Maurice,
to see him set in a cloud of looming tragedy.
He looked more beautiful to her in this cloud
than he had looked before. Lily thought it
might be wicked, but somehow she could not help
loving mental suffering&mdash;in others. And the face
of Maurice gazed at her in the blackness beneath
a shadowy crown of thorns.</p>

<p>Next day, at the early service, she was inattentive
to the ministrations of religion. Her
father seemed a puppet at its prayers, the choir
a row of surpliced dolls, the organ an empty
voice. Only at the end, when silence fell on the
kneeling worshippers, did she wake with a start
of contrition to the knowledge of her impiety,
and blush between her little hands at her concentration
upon the suspected sorrow of the
young doctor. But in that night and that morning
Lily ran forward towards Maurice, set her
feet upon the line that divides men from women.
She knew that she had done so only when she
next encountered him. Then, as their eyes met
she was seized with a painful idea of guilt, bred
by an absurd feeling that he could see into her
mind, and know how all her thoughts had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
crowding about him. It is a dangerous symptom
that sensation of one's mind being visible to another
as a thing observed through glass. Lily
did not understand her danger, but she was full
of a turmoil of uneasiness. Maurice noticed it
and felt conscious also, as if some secret understanding
existed between him and Lily, yet there
was none, there could be none.</p>

<p>In conclave the individually stupid can sometimes
almost touch cleverness. Brayfield only
began to talk steadily about Lily and the young
doctor from the day of this meeting of self-consciousnesses
which had, as it chanced, taken place
on the pavement of the curved parade by the sea.
Till that day the little town had attributed to
Maurice hopelessness, to Lily simply friendship
for a sad young man. Now its members talked
the usual gossip that attends the flirtations of the
sincere, but added to it a considerable divergence
of opinions as to the likelihood of Maurice's conversion
from despair. Lily, they were all decided,
began to love Maurice. But some believed and
some denied, that Maurice began to love Lily.
This would have been hard for Lily had she
noticed it, but her fanciful and enthusiastic mind
was concentrated on one thing only and her range
of vision was consequently narrowed. She was
incessantly engaged in trying to trace the footsteps
of the doctor's misery, of which she was now
fully convinced. And indeed, since that Sabbath
evening already described, Maurice had scarcely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
endeavoured to play any part of ordinary happiness
to her. Her partial penetration of his secret
quickly brought a sense of relief to him. There
was something consoling in the idea that this
little girl divined his loneliness of soul, if not its
reason.</p>

<p>By degrees they grew quietly so accustomed to
the silent familiarity existing between their ebbing
and flowing thoughts; they were&mdash;without
a word spoken&mdash;so thoroughly certain of the
language their minds were uttering to each other,
that when their lips did speak at length, the
words that came were like a continuance of an
already long conversation.</p>

<p>Lily was, once more, knocked up, and the Canon
called in Maurice to prescribe. He arrived in the
late afternoon and was taken by the Canon into
Lily's little sitting-room, where she lay on a couch
by the fire. A small, shaded, reading lamp defined
the shadows craftily.</p>

<p>"Now, Dale," the Canon said, "for goodness'
sake tell her to be more orderly and to do less&mdash;mind
and body. She behaves as if life was a
whirlpool. She swims stupendously, tell her to
float&mdash;and give her a tonic."</p>

<p>And he went out of the room shaking his head
at the culprit on the couch.</p>

<p>When the door had shut upon him, Maurice
came up to the fire in silence and looked at Lily.
She smiled at him rather hopelessly, and then
suddenly she said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor dear father! To ask you to make me
take life so easily!"</p>

<p>That remark was the first onward gliding of
their minds in speech, the uttered continuance
of the hitherto silent colloquy between them.
Maurice sat down. He accepted the irony of
the situation suggested by the Canon without
attempt at a protest.</p>

<p>"Life can never be easy, if one thinks," he
said. Then, trying to adopt the medical tone, he
added:</p>

<p>"But you think too much. I have often felt
that lately."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>Her eyes were bent on him with a scrutiny that
was nearly ungirlish. Maurice tried not to see it
as he put his fingers on her wrist. She added:</p>

<p>"I have felt that about you too."</p>

<p>Maurice had taken out his watch. Without
speaking he timed the fluttering pulsation of her
life, then, dropping her hand and returning the
watch to his pocket:</p>

<p>"Your too eager thoughts were of me?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, but yours were not of me."</p>

<p>"Not always," he said, with an honesty that
pleased her.</p>

<p>And again Lily saw above his face the shadowy
crown of thorns. She was really unwell and
ready to be unstrung. Perhaps this made her
say hastily, as she shifted lower on her cushions:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm partly ill to-day because you let me see
how horribly you are suffering."</p>

<p>"Yes," Maurice said heavily. "I let you see
it. Why's that?"</p>

<p>There was nothing like a shock to either of
them in the directness of their words. They
seemed spoken rightly at the inevitable time.
No thought of question, of denial, was entertained
by them. Maurice sat there by her and
dropped his mask utterly.</p>

<p>"Miss Alston, I am a haunted man," he said.</p>

<p>And, in a moment, as he spoke, he seemed to
be old. Lily said nothing. She twisted between
her little fingers the thin rug that covered her,
and was angry with herself because, all of a
sudden, she wanted to cry.</p>

<p>"And I am beginning to wonder," Maurice went
on, "how much longer I can bear it, just how long."</p>

<p>Lily cleared her throat. It struck her as odd
that she did not feel strange with this man who
looked so old in the thin light from the lamp.
Indeed, now that the mask had entirely fallen
from him, he seemed more familiar to her than
ever before.</p>

<p>"I suppose we must bear everything so long as
God chooses," she said.</p>

<p>"No, so long as we choose."</p>

<p>"But how?"</p>

<p>"To live to bear it. I cannot be haunted after
I am dead. That can't be."</p>

<p>He lifted his head and looked at her with a sort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of pale defiance, as if he would dare her to contradict
him. Lily confronted the horror of his
eyes, and a shudder ran over her. The thorns
had pierced more deeply even than she had believed
as she lay awake in the night. Just then
a door banged and a footstep approached on the
landing.</p>

<p>"Hush, it's father," Lily whispered.</p>

<p>And the Canon entered to ask the condition of
the patient. Maurice prescribed and went away.
In the windy evening as he walked, he was conscious
of a large change dawning over his life.
Either the spirit of prophecy&mdash;which comes to
many men even in modern days&mdash;was upon
him, or hope, which he believed quite dead in
him, stirred faintly in his dream. In either event
he saw that on the black walk of his life there was
the irregular, and as yet paltry, line of some writing,
some inscription. He could not read the
words. He only knew that there were some words
to be read. And one of them was surely Lily's
name.</p>

<p>He did not meet her until the evening of the
following Sunday when, as usual, he went to supper
at the Rectory. Lily was better and had
been to church. The Canon was delighted and
thanked Maurice for his skill in diagnosis and in
treatment.</p>

<p>"You cure every one," he said.</p>

<p>Lily and Maurice exchanged a glance. He
saw how well she understood that he felt the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
words to be an irony though they were uttered
so innocently. After supper, just as the Canon,
with his habitual Sunday sigh of satisfaction, was
beginning to light his pipe, Sarah, the parlour maid,
came in with a note. The Canon read it and his
sigh moved onwards to something not unlike a
groan. He put his filled pipe down on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"What is it, father?" asked Lily.</p>

<p>"Miss Bigelow," he replied laconically.</p>

<p>"On a Sunday. Oh, it's too bad!"</p>

<p>"It can't be helped," the Canon said. "Excuse
me, Dale, I have to go out. But&mdash;stay&mdash;I
shall be back in half an hour."</p>

<p>And he went out into the hall, took his coat
and hat and left the house. Miss Bigelow was
his cross. She was a rich invalid, portentously
delicate, full of benefactions to the parish and
fears for the welfare of her soul. She kept the
Canon's charities going royally, but, in return,
she claimed the Canon's ghostly ministrations at
odd times to an extent that sometimes caused the
good man's saintly equanimity to totter. Hating
doctors and loving clergymen, Miss Bigelow was
forever summoning her distracted father confessor
to speed that parting guest&mdash;her soul, which
however, never departed. She remarked in confidence
to those about her, that she had endured
"a dozen deathbeds." The Canon had sat beside
them all. He must now take his way to the
thirteenth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the hall door banged Maurice looked
up at Lily.</p>

<p>"Poor, dear father," she murmured.</p>

<p>"I am glad," Maurice said abruptly.</p>

<p>The remark might have been called rude, but
it was so simply made that it had the dignity
belonging to any statement of plain truth.
Neither rude nor polite, it was merely a cry of
fact from an overburdened human soul. Lily felt
that the words were forced from the young doctor
by some strange agitation that fought to find expression.</p>

<p>"You wish&mdash;you wish&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>Then she stopped. The flood of expression
that welled up in her companion's face frightened
her. She trembled at the thought of the hidden
thing, the force, that could loose such a sea.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she said like a schoolgirl&mdash;or so,
a moment afterwards, she feared.</p>

<p>"I ought not to tell you," Maurice said, "I
ought not, but I must&mdash;I must."</p>

<p>He had got up and was standing before her.
His back was to the fire, and a shadow was over
his face.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you. You have made me want
to. Why is that?"</p>

<p>He spoke as if he were questioning his own intellect
for the reason, not asking it of her. And
she did not try to answer his question.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he continued, "it is because you
are the only human being who has partially understood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
that there is something with me that sets
me apart from all my kind, from all the others."</p>

<p>"With you?" Lily said.</p>

<p>She felt horribly frightened and yet strong and
earnest.</p>

<p>"Yes, with me," he answered. "I told you that
I was a haunted man. Miss Alston, can you, will
you bear to hear what it is that is with me, and
why it comes. It is a story that, perhaps, your
father might forbid you to read. I don't know.
And, if it was fiction, perhaps he would be right.
But&mdash;but&mdash;I think&mdash;I wonder&mdash;you might help
me. I can't see how, but&mdash;I feel&mdash;"</p>

<p>He faltered suddenly, and seemed for the first
time to become self-conscious and confused.</p>

<p>"Tell me, please," Lily said.</p>

<p>She felt rather as if she were beginning to read
some strange French story by night. Maurice
still stood on the hearth.</p>

<p>"It is a sound that is with me," he said. "Only
that; never anything else but that."</p>

<p>"A sound," she repeated.</p>

<p>She thought of their conversation about the
bells.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a cry&mdash;the cry of a child."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"That's nothing&mdash;you think? Absurd for a
man to heed such a trifle?"</p>

<p>"Why do you think it comes?"</p>

<p>Maurice hesitated. His eyes searched the face
of the little girl with an almost hard gaze of scrutiny,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
as if he were trying to sum up the details of
her nature.</p>

<p>"Long ago&mdash;before I came here, before I was
qualified, I was cruel, bitterly cruel to a child,"
he said at last, speaking now very coldly and
distinctly.</p>

<p>His eyes were on Lily. Had she made just
then any movement of horror or of disgust, had an
expression betokening fear of him come into her
eyes, Maurice knew that his lips would be sealed,
that he would bid her good-night and leave her.
But she only looked more intent, more expectant.
He went on.</p>

<p>"I was bitterly cruel to my own child," he said.</p>

<p>Then Lily moved suddenly. Maurice thought
she was going to start up. If she had intended
to she choked the impulse. Was she shocked?
He could not tell. She had turned her face away
from him. He wondered why, but he did not
know that those last words had given to Lily an
abrupt and fiery insight into the depths of her
heart.</p>

<p>"At that time," Maurice said, still speaking
very distinctly and quietly, "I was desperately
ambitious. I was bitten by the viper whose poison,
stealing through all a man's veins, is emulation.
My only desire, my only aim in life was to
beat all the men of my year, to astonish all the
authorities of the hospital to which I was attached
by the brilliance of my attainments and my
achievements, I was ambition incarnate, and such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
mad ambition is the most cruel thing in the world.
And my child interfered with my ambition. It
cried, how it cried!"</p>

<p>He was becoming less definitely calm.</p>

<p>"It cried through my dreams, my thoughts,
my endeavours, my determinations. Do you know
what a weapon a sound can be, Miss Alston?
Perhaps not. A sound can be like a sword and
pierce you, like a bludgeon and strike you down.
A little sound can nestle in your life, and change
all the colour and all the meaning of it. The cry
of the living child was terrible to me, I thought
then. But&mdash;then&mdash;I had never heard the cry of
the dead child. You see I wanted to forget something.
And the tiny cry of the child recalled it.
There were no words in the cry, and yet there
were words,&mdash;so it seemed to me&mdash;telling over a
past history. This history&mdash;well, I want to say to
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lily had now put a guard on watch over against
her impulsive nature. When Maurice stopped
speaking she was able to look towards him again
and murmur:</p>

<p>"Say all you want to."</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, almost eagerly. "If you
knew&mdash;Miss Alston, before this time, when I was
a very young student, I had fallen into one of the
most fatal confusions of youth. I had made a
mistake as to the greatest need of my own
nature. I had, for a flash of time, thought my
greatest need was love."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"And it wasn't," the girl said, with a note of
wonder in her voice.</p>

<p>"No, it was success, to outstrip my fellows.
But I thought it was love, and I followed my
thought and I sacrificed another to my thought.
My child's mother died almost in giving her to
me, and, in dying, made me promise to keep the
child always with me. I kept that promise. I
was a young student, very poor. My love had
been secret. Now I was alone with this helpless
child. I left my own lodgings and took others.
I brought it there, and its presence obliged me to
shut my doors against my own family and against
my friends. To keep the door shut I put forward
the excuse of my ambition. I said that I
was giving myself up to work and I shut myself
in with the child. I was its nurse as well as its
father. I thought I should be sufficient for it.
But it missed&mdash;her, whom I scarcely missed."</p>

<p>"You had not loved her?"</p>

<p>Maurice bent his head.</p>

<p>"I had made a mistake, as I said. I had only
thought so. Long before she died I had almost
hated her for crippling my ambition. She was
swept out of my path. But the child was left
crying for her."</p>

<p>"Yes. I know."</p>

<p>"Its wail came eternally between me and my
great desire. When I sat down to work the
sound&mdash;which I could not quiet&mdash;perplexed my
brain. When I lay down to get, in sleep, power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
for fresh work, it struck through my dreams. I
heard it when the stars were out over London,
and in the dawn, when from my lodging windows
I could see the first light on the Thames. Miss
Alston, at last it maddened me."</p>

<p>Lily was pale. She scarcely knew of what she
was expectant.</p>

<p>"I had tried to comfort the child. I had failed.
Now I determined to forget it, to shut it out
from my working life. At last, by force of will, I
almost succeeded. I read, I wrote, I analysed
the causes of disease, the results of certain treatments
as opposed to the results of others. And
sometimes I no longer heard my child, no longer
knew whether it wailed and wept or whether it
was silent. But one evening&mdash;"</p>

<p>Maurice stopped. His face was very white and
his eyes burned with excitement.</p>

<p>"One evening," he repeated, speaking almost
with difficulty, and with the obstinate note in his
voice of one telling a secret half against his will
and better judgement, "I could not work. The
wail of the child was so loud, so alarmed, so full
of a fear that seemed to my imagination intelligent,
and based on a knowledge of something I
did not know, that my professional instinct was
aroused. At first I listened, sitting at my writing
table. Then I got up and softly approached
the folding doors. Beyond them, in the dark,
the child lamented like one to whom a nameless
horror draws near. Never had I known it to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
weep like this; for this was no cry after a mother,
no cry of desire, no cry even of sorrow. It was a
half-strangled scream of terror, I did not go into
the room, but as I listened, I knew&mdash;"</p>

<p>He faltered.</p>

<p>"Yes," Lily said.</p>

<p>"As I listened I knew what the cry meant.
Miss Alston, is it not strange that even a baby
who scarcely knows life knows so well&mdash;death?"</p>

<p>"Death!"</p>

<p>"Yes, recognises its coming, shrinks from it,
fears it with the terror of a clear intelligence. Is
it not very strange?"</p>

<p>"Death!" Lily repeated.</p>

<p>She too was pale. Maurice continued in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"I understood the meaning of the cry, and I
did not enter the inner room. No, I walked back
to my writing table, put my hands over my ears&mdash;to
deaden the cry&mdash;and gave myself again to
work. How long I worked I don't know, but
presently I heard a loud knocking at the door of
my room. I sprang up and opened it. My landlady
stood outside.</p>

<p>"'What do you want?' I asked.</p>

<p>"The good woman's face was grave.</p>

<p>"'Sir, I know that child must be ill,' she said.</p>

<p>"'Ill&mdash;why? What do you mean?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, sir, its crying is awful. It goes right
through me.'</p>

<p>"I pushed the woman out almost roughly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"'It is not ill,' I said. 'It is only restless.
Leave me. Don't you see I am working?'</p>

<p>"And I shut the door sharply. I sat down
again at my table and toiled till dawn. I remember
that dawn so well. At last my brain had
utterly tired. I could work no longer. I pushed
away my papers and got up. The room was
misty&mdash;so I thought&mdash;with a flickering grey light.
The dirty white blind was drawn half up. I
looked out over the river, and from it I heard the
dull shout of a man on a black barge. This shout
recalled to me my child and the noise of its
lament. I listened. All was silent. There was
no murmur from the inner room. And then I remember
that suddenly the silence, for which I
had so often longed and prayed, frightened me.
It seemed full of a dreadful meaning. I waited a
moment. Then I walked softly across the room
to the folding doors. They were closed, I opened
them furtively and looked into the bedroom. It
was nearly dark. Approaching the bed I could
scarcely discern the tiny white heap which marked
where the child lay among the tumbled bedclothes.
I bent down to listen to the sound of
its breathing. I could not hear the sound. Then
I caught the child in my arms and carried it over
to the sitting-room window so that the dawn
might strike upon its little face. The face was
discoloured. The heart was not beating. Miss
Alston, while I worked, my child had died in a
convulsion. It had striven against death, poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
feeble baby, and had had no help from its father.
My medical skill might have eased its sufferings.
Might have saved it. But I had deliberately
closed my ears to its appeal for love, for assistance.
I had let it go. I should never hear it again."</p>

<p>Maurice had spoken the last words with excitement.
Now he paused. With an obvious effort
he controlled himself and added calmly:</p>

<p>"I buried my child and gave myself again to
work. My examination was close at hand. I
passed it brilliantly. But I shuddered at my
success. Those lodgings by the river had become
horrible to me. I left them, took a practice in a
remote Cumberland valley, and withdrew myself
from the world, from all who had known me. In
this retirement, however, I had a companion of
whose presence at first I was unaware. The dead
child followed me, the child of whom now I feel
myself to have been the murderer."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;not that!" Lily whispered. But
he did not seem to hear her.</p>

<p>"One night," he continued, "in my lonely
house in the valley I was awakened by some
sound. I sat up in bed and listened. All was
black around me, and at first all was quiet too. I
lay down again to sleep. But as I touched the
pillow I heard a faint murmur that seemed to
come from far away. I said to myself that it was
a fancy of my mind but again it came. Then I
thought it was the wind caught in some cranny
of my house. I opened my window and leaned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
out. But there was no wind in the trees. What
was the noise then? The cry of a bird perhaps.
Yes, it must be that. Yet did any note of a bird
have a thrill of pain in it? I hurried on some
clothes and let myself out into the garden. I
would hear that bird again. I would convince
myself of its presence. But in the garden I could
hear nothing save the thin murmur of the
stream that threaded the valley. So I returned
to the house, and at the door I was greeted
by a little cry from within. Miss Alston, it was
the cry of my dead child, full of pain and of
eternal reproach. I shut the door, closing myself
in with my fate, and since that night I have
been a haunted man. Scarcely a day has passed
since then, scarcely a night has gone by without
my hearing that appeal for help which once I disregarded,
which now I can never reply to. I fled
from the valley, in a vain hope of leaving that
voice behind me. I came here. But the child's
spirit is here too. It is forever with me."</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly, then he added, "I can
even hear it now, while I look at you, while I
touch your hand."</p>

<p>His burning eyes were fixed on Lily's face.
His burning hand closed on hers as if seeking assistance.</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" he said, and for the first
time his voice broke and failed.</p>

<p>"Pray!" she whispered.</p>

<p>"I have prayed. But God forgives only those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
who reverse their evil acts. Mine can never be
reversed. I can never be kind to my child to
whom I have been bitterly cruel. There is no
help for me, none. Yet I had a feeling that&mdash;that
you might help me."</p>

<p>"If I could!" the girl cried with a blaze of
sudden eagerness. Her heart leaped up at the
words, leaped up from its depth of pity for Maurice
to a height of almost fiery enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"But how?" he said.</p>

<p>Then his face hardened and grew stern.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "there can be no help for me,
none in this world."</p>

<p>The drawing-room door opened and the Canon
appeared.</p>

<p>"Miss Bigelow has not died for the thirteenth
time," he said, coming up to the fire.</p>

<p>When the Canon kissed his daughter that
night, after Maurice Dale had gone home, he
seemed struck by a new expression in her face.</p>

<p>"Why, how excited you look, child!" he said,
"what is it?"</p>

<p>But Lily returned his kiss hastily and ran away
without a word. Once in her room she locked
the door&mdash;for no reason except that she must
mark the night by some unwonted action&mdash;put
on her dressing-gown and threw herself down on
her bed. Her mind was alive with thoughts.
Her imagination was in flames. For so much had
come upon her that evening. In the first place
she understood that she loved Maurice. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
knew that, when he spoke the words, "My child,"
and jealousy of an unknown woman struck like
some sharp weapon to her heart. She realised
that he did not love her, yet so great was her
simple unselfishness, that she did not dwell on the
knowledge, or blame for an instant the selfishness
which concentrated Maurice's mind so entirely
upon himself and his own sorrow. Her only
anxiety was how to help him. Her only feeling
was one of tender pity for his agony. And yet,
for Lily was a girl of many fancies and full of the
wilful side-thoughts of women, she found room
in her nature for a highflown sense of personal
romance which now wrapped her round in a certain
luxury of complacency. She moved in a
strange story that was true, a story that she might
have read with a quickening of the pulses. She
and Maurice, whom she loved, moved in it together
heroine and hero of it. And none knew
the story but themselves. And then she burst
into silent tears, calling herself cruel for having
this moment of half joy in the tragedy of another.
She pushed down into the depths of Maurice's
misery. And then, with a clearer mind, she sat
up on the bed. It was dead of night now. Was
he listening in the silence to that haunting cry that
was destroying him? She wondered breathlessly.
And she recalled the conversation about "The
Bells." Was Mathias truly haunted? or was he
mad? She asked herself that, putting Maurice
eventually behind footlights in his place. Was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
there really a veritable cry, allowed to come out
of the other world to Maurice? or did his diseased
brain work out his retribution? She could not
tell. Indeed she scarcely cared just then. In
either event, the result upon him was the same
and was terrible. In either event, the outcome
might be what she dared not name even to herself.
And, though he did not love her, he turned to her
for help. Lily flushed in the thought of this.
Almost more than if she had his heart it seemed
to have his cry for assistance. She must answer
it effectually. She must. But how? And then
she sprang up and began to pace the room. How
to help him. Slowly, and with a minute examination,
she went in memory through his story,
with its egoism, its cruelty, its ambition, its punishment,
its childlike helplessness of to-night, and of
many nights. She recalled each word that he had
spoken until she came to almost the last, "I have
prayed. But God forgives only those who reverse
their evil acts. Mine can never be reversed. I
can never be kind to my child&mdash;" Just there
she stopped. Maurice's words flew against what
Lily's religion taught her of the Great Being who
can pardon simply and fully so long only as the
sinner entirely and deeply repents. But she accepted
them as true for Maurice. There was the
point to be faced. She felt that his nature, haunted
indeed or betrayed by its own weakness, but
still loved by her, could only be restored to peace
if he could fulfil the impossible, reverse&mdash;as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
expressed it&mdash;that act of his past. Ah, that cry
of the little dying, helpless child, of his little
child. Lily could almost hear it too, the tears
came into her eyes. How could she still it? How
could she lay the little spirit to rest forever?
Peace for child, peace for father, sinned against
and sinner&mdash;she felt she would gladly sacrifice her
own life, her own peace, to work the miracle of
comfort on dead and living. Yes, she could give
up her love,&mdash;if&mdash;. Suddenly Lily threw herself
down on her bed and buried her burning face deep
in the pillows. A thought had come to her, so
strange that she wondered whether it were not
wicked. The hot red colour surged over her with
this thought, and all the woman in her quivered
as she asked herself whether, in this life of sorrows
and of abnegations, it could ever be that the
grief and the terror of another could be swept
away by one who, in the endeavour to bring
solace, must obtain intense personal happiness.
In books it is ever self-sacrifice that purges and
persuades, martyrdom of the senses that renews
and relieves. Lily was ready indeed to be a
martyr for the man she loved. But the strange
way she saw of being his possible saviour lay only
in a light of the sun forever on herself.</p>

<p>She wept and saw the light, herself and Maurice
walking in it together, till the church bell
chimed in the morning, and the tide came up in
the sunshine to murmur that it was day.</p>

<hr class="hr1" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Maurice Dale was puzzled. He noticed a
change in Lily so marked that even his self-centred
nature could not fail to observe it. This girl,
whom he had thought pretty, fanciful, tenderhearted
and gently sympathetic, who had attracted
his confession by her quick and feminine receptiveness,
now seemed developed into a woman
of strength and purpose, full of calm and of dignity.
Her shining eyes were more steadfast than
of old, her manner was less changeful, less enthusiastic,
but more reliant. Brayfield wondered what
had come to Miss Alston. Maurice wondered too,
dating the transformation accurately from the
night when he unburdened his soul in search of
the help, which, after all, no human being could
give to him. It was strange, he thought, that a
man's terror, a man's weakness, should endow
a weak girl with confidence and with power. It
was too strange, and he laughed at himself for
supposing that he had anything to do with the
new manifestation of Lily's nature. Nevertheless
she began to attract him more than he had
believed possible. The nightmare in which his
life was encircled grew less real when he was with
her. There was virtue in her that went out to
him. He came to desire always to be with her
and yet he could not say to himself that he loved
her with the passion of man for woman. Rather
was the desire that he felt for her like that of a
criminal towards a place of refuge, of a coward
towards an asylum of safety. Sometimes he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
longed that she might share his trouble, selfishly
longed that in her ears might ring the cry of pain
that tormented his.</p>

<p>One day, when they were together on a down
that overlooked the sea, he told her this.</p>

<p>"I wish it too," she answered softly.</p>

<p>"You are all unselfishness, as I am all selfishness,"
he said, condemning himself, and nearer to
loving her than ever before.</p>

<p>The sails went by along the wintry sea, and the
short afternoon faded quickly into a twilight
that was cold in its beauty like a pale primrose
in frost. They were descending slowly
towards the little town that lay beneath them in
the shadows.</p>

<p>"I have no voice to trouble my life,&mdash;no dead
voice, that is," Lily said.</p>

<p>"No dead voice?" Maurice asked. "And the
living?"</p>

<p>"Oh, in most lives there is some one voice
that means almost too much," Lily answered
slowly.</p>

<p>Maurice stopped.</p>

<p>"Whose voice means so much to you?" he
said.</p>

<p>"Why do you care to ask?"</p>

<p>"Is it mine?"</p>

<p>The girl had stopped too. Her face was set
towards the sea and its great sincerity, which
murmurs against the lies and the deceptions of
many lives that defile the land, and takes so many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
more to itself that they may persist no longer
in their evil doing. And perhaps it was her vision
of the sea that swept from Lily any desire
to be a coquette, or to be maidenly,&mdash;that is,
false. She looked from the sea into Maurice's
eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered. "It is yours."</p>

<p>"You love me then, Lily?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I love you, Maurice."</p>

<p>There was no tremor in her voice. There was
no shame in her eyes. Alone in her chamber on
the night of Maurice's confession she had flushed
and trembled. Now she stood before him and
made this great acknowledgement simply and fearlessly.
And yet she knew that he did not love
her with the desire of man to the woman whom
he chooses out of the world to be his companion.
She was moved by a resolve that was
very great to ignore all that girls think most of
at such a moment. Maurice took a step towards
her. How true and how strong she looked.</p>

<p>"I dare not ask you to share my life," he said.
"It is too shadowed, too sad. I have not the
right."</p>

<p>"If you will ask me, I will share it."</p>

<p>She put her hand into his. He felt as if her
soul lay in it. They walked on. Already the
evening was dark around them.</p>

<p>Canon Alston was a little surprised, merely because
he was a father, and fathers are always a
little surprised when men love their children.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
But he liked Maurice heartily and gave his consent
to the marriage. Miss Bigelow ordered a
valuable wedding-present, and resolved to live until
over the marriage day at least. And Brayfield
gossiped and gloried in possessing a legitimate
cause for excitement.</p>

<p>As for Lily, she was strangely happy with a
happiness far different from that of the usual betrothed
young girl. She loved Maurice deeply.
Nevertheless she did not blind herself to the fact
that he was still unhappy, restless, self-engrossed
and often terror-stricken, although he tried to
appear more confident than of old, and to assume
a gaiety suitable to his situation in the eyes of
the world. She knew he could never be entirely
free to love so long as the cry of the child rang
in his ears. And he told her that, strangely
enough, since their engagement it had become
more importunate. Once he even tried to break
their contract.</p>

<p>"I cannot link my life with another's," he said
desperately. "Who knows&mdash;when you are one
with me, you may be haunted as I am. That
would be too horrible."</p>

<p>It was a flash of real and heartfelt unselfishness.
Lily felt herself thrill with gratitude. But she
only said:</p>

<p>"I am not afraid."</p>

<p>On another occasion&mdash;this was about a month
after they became engaged&mdash;Maurice said:</p>

<p>"Lily, when shall we be married?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>She glanced up at him, and saw that he was
paler even than usual, and that his face looked
drawn with fatigue.</p>

<p>"Whenever you wish," she answered.</p>

<p>"Let it be soon," he said. And then he broke
out almost despairingly:</p>

<p>"I cannot bear this much longer. Lily, what
can it mean? There is something too strange.
Ever since you and I have been betrothed the
curse that is laid upon me has been heavier, the
cry of the child has been more incessantly with
me. I hear it more plainly. It is nearer to me.
It is close to me. In the night sometimes I start
up thinking the child is even beside me on the
pillow, complaining to me in the darkness. I
stretch out my hand. I feel for its little body.
But there is nothing&mdash;nothing but that cry of
fear, of pain, of eternal reproach. Why does the
spirit persecute me now as it never persecuted
me before? Is it because it believes that you
will make me happier? Is it because it wishes to
deny me all earthly joy? Sometimes I think
that, once we are actually husband and wife the
cry will die away. Sometimes I think that then
it will never leave me even for a moment. If
that were so, Lily, I should die, or I should lose
my reason."</p>

<p>He covered his face with his hands. He was
trembling. Lily put her soft hand against his
hands. A great light had come into her eyes as
he spoke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let us be married, Maurice," she said. "Perhaps
the little child wants me."</p>

<p>He looked up at her and his dark eyes seemed
to pierce her, hungry for help.</p>

<p>"Wants you?" he said. "How can that be?
No, no. It cries against my thought of happiness,
against my desire for peace."</p>

<p>"We must give it peace. We must lay it to
rest."</p>

<p>"No one can do that. If I have not the power
to redeem my deed of wickedness, how can you,
how can any one living redeem it for me?"</p>

<p>Lily looked away from him. Her cheeks were
burning with a blush. A tingling fire seemed to
run through all her veins and her pulses beat.</p>

<p>"There is some way of redemption for every
one," she said.</p>

<p>But he answered gloomily:</p>

<p>"Your religion teaches you to say that, Lily,
perhaps to believe it. But there is no way. The
dead cannot return to earth that we may give
them tenderness instead of our former cruelty.
No&mdash;no!"</p>

<p>"Maurice&mdash;trust me. Let us be married&mdash;soon."</p>

<p>That night, before she went to bed, Lily knelt
down and prayed until the night was old. She
asked what thousands of women have asked since
the world was young. But surely never woman
before had so strange a reason for her request.
And when at length she rose from her knees she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
felt that time must bring the gift she had prayed
for, unselfishly, and with her whole heart.</p>

<p>A month afterwards, on a bright spring morning,
Maurice and Lily were married. It was a
great occasion for Brayfield. The church was
elaborately decorated by the many young ladies
who had secretly longed to be the brides of the
interesting doctor. Crowds assembled within and
without the building. Miss Bigelow rose from
her fourteenth death-bed in a purple satin gown
and a bonnet prodigious with feathers and testified
to the possibility of modern resurrection in
a front pew. Flowers, rice, wedding marches
filled the air. But people remarked that the
bridegroom looked like a man who went in fear.
Even when he was on the doorstep of the church
in the throng of curious sightseers he moved almost
as one whom a dream attends, who sees the
pale figures, who hears the faint voices that inhabit
and make musical a vision of the night.
The bride too, had no radiant air of a young girl
fulfilling her girlish destiny and giving herself up
to a protector, to one stronger, more able to fight
the world than a woman who loves and fears.
Her face, too, was pale and grave, even&mdash;some
thought&mdash;a little stern. As she passed up the
church she glanced at no one, smiled at no
friend. Her eyes were set steadfastly towards
the altar where Maurice waited. And when,
after the ceremony, she came down the church
to the sound of music her eyes were fixed on her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
husband. She took no heed of any one else, for
her hand pressed upon his arm, felt that he was
trembling. And her ears seemed to hear through
all the jubilant music, through all the murmur of
the gazing crowd, a cry, far away, yet more distinct
than any sound of earth, thin, piercing, full
of appeal to her&mdash;the spirit-cry of the child.</p>

<h3>PART II.<br />
THE LIVING CHILD.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> honeymoon of Lily and Maurice was
short, and many would have called it sad, could
they have known how different it was from
the marriage holiday of most young couples.
Maurice had looked forward to the wedding as a
desperate man looks forward to a new point of
departure in his life. He had fixed all his hopes
of possible peace upon it. He had dated new
days of calm, if not of brightness, from it. He
had sometimes vaguely, sometimes desperately,
looked to it as to a miracle day, on which&mdash;how
or why he knew not&mdash;the shadow would be lifted
from his life. The man who is doomed to death
has a moment of acute expectation when some
new doctor places him under a fresh mode of
treatment. For a few days the increased vitality
of his anxious mind sheds a dawn of apparent life
through his body. But the mind collapses. The
dawn fades. The darkness increases, death steals
on. So it was with Maurice. Immediately after
the wedding, Lily noticed that he fell into a
strangely watchful condition of abstraction. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
was full of tenderness to her, full of cares for her
comfort, but even in his moments of obvious solicitude
he seemed to be on the alert to catch the
stir of some remote activity, or to be listening for
the sound of some distant voice. His own fate
engrossed him even in this first period of novel
companionship with another soul. The monomania
of the haunted man gripped him and would
not release him. He thought of Lily, but he
thought more, and with a deeper passion, of himself.</p>

<p>The girl divined this, but she did not for an instant
rebel. She had set up a beautiful unselfishness
in her heart and had consecrated it. Purpose
does much for a woman, helps her sometimes to
rise higher than perhaps man can ever rise, to the
pale and vacant peaks of an inactive martyrdom.
And Lily was full of a passion of purpose known
only to herself. She loved Maurice not merely as
a girl loves a man, but also as the protective woman
loves the being dependent upon her. His secret
was hers, but hers was not his. She had her beautiful
loneliness of silent hope, and that sustained
her.</p>

<p>They went away together. In the train
Maurice said to her suddenly, with a sort of blaze
of hungry eagerness:</p>

<p>"Lily&mdash;Lily&mdash;to-day there is a silence for me.
Oh, Lily, if you have brought me silence."</p>

<p>He seized her hand and his was hot like fire.</p>

<p>"Will it last&mdash;can it last?" he whispered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>And he glanced all round the carriage like one
anticipating an answer to his question from some
unknown quarter, then he said:</p>

<p>"The noise of the train is so loud, perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" Lily said. "Don't fight your own
peace, Maurice."</p>

<p>"Fight it&mdash;no, but I can scarcely believe in it.
Lately the&mdash;it has been so ceaseless, so poignant.
Lily, I have had a fancy that you alone could be
my saviour. If it is so! Ah, but how can that
be?"</p>

<p>She gave him a strange answer.</p>

<p>"Maurice," she said, "it may be so, but do not
despair if the cry comes again."</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed almost fiercely, "you&mdash;do
you hear it then?"</p>

<p>"No, no, but it may come."</p>

<p>"It shall not. The silence is so beautiful."</p>

<p>He put his arms around her. The tears had
sprung into his eyes.</p>

<p>"How weak I am," he said, with a fury against
his own condition, "you must despise me."</p>

<p>"I love you," she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her with a creeping astonishment.</p>

<p>"I wonder why," he said, slowly. "How can
you love a man who has been so miserable that
he has almost ceased to be a man?"</p>

<p>"I love even your misery. Don't think me
selfish, Maurice. But it was your sorrow, you
see, that first taught you to think of me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>He leaned from her suddenly towards the
window which was open and pulled it sharply up.</p>

<p>"Why do you do that?" Lily said quickly.</p>

<p>"One hears such noises in the air when one
travels at this speed," he answered. "With the
window down one might fancy anything. I must
shut out fancy. There are voices in the wind
that passes, in the rustling woods that we rush
through. I won't hear them."</p>

<p>The train sped on.</p>

<p>Their destination was an inland village set in
the midst of a rolling purple moor, isolated in a
heather-clad gold of the land, distant from the
sea, distant from the murmur of modern life; a
sleepy, self-contented and serene abode of quiet
women and ruminant men, living, loving, and
dying with a greater calm than often pervades
our modern life. A lazy divinity seemed to
preside over the place, in spring-time at least.
Men strolled about their work as if Time waited
on them, not they on Time. The children&mdash;so
Maurice thought&mdash;played more drowsily than the
children of towns. The youths were contemplative.
Even the girls often forgot to giggle as
they thought of wedding rings and Sunday love-making.
Little dogs lay blinking before the low-browed
doors of the cottages, and cats reposed
upon the garden walls round-eyed in sober
dreams. If Maurice sought a home of silence
surely he had it here. Lily and he put up at a
small inn on the skirt of the village and facing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the rippling emptiness of the moor. Before going
to bed they stepped out into the night and the
wide air. Stars were bright in the sky. Cottage
lights twinkled here and there behind them in
the village. They heard a stream running away
into the heart of the long solitude that lay beyond
them. Lily was very quiet. Her heart was full.
Thoughts, strange and beautiful, overflowed in
her mind. She felt just then how much bigger
the human soul is than the human body, how
much stronger the prisoner is than the prison in
which nevertheless it is dedicated to dwell for a
time. Her hand just touched the arm of Maurice
as she looked across the soft darkness of the moor.
He, too, felt curiously happy and safe. Taking
off his cap he passed his hand over his hair.</p>

<p>"Lily," he said, "peace is here for me, in
this place with you. My brain has been playing
me tricks because I have been so much alone, the
devil dwells in a man's loneliness. Listen to the
silence of these moors. What a music it is!"</p>

<p>The lights in the cottages were extinguished
one by one, as bed claimed their owners. But
Maurice and Lily, sitting on the dry fringe of
the heather, remained out under the stars. Her
hand lay in his and suddenly she felt his quiver.</p>

<p>"What is it, Maurice?" she asked.</p>

<p>He got up and made a step forward.</p>

<p>"Lily," he said, "there is&mdash;there must be
some one near us, a child lost on the moor, or
forgotten by its mother. I hear it crying close to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
us. Say you hear it too. No, no, it is not the
old sound. Don't think that. It can't be.
There's a natural explanation of this&mdash;I'll swear
there is. Come with me."</p>

<p>He pulled her hastily up and pressed forward
some steps, stumbling among the bushes. Then
he stopped, listening.</p>

<p>"It is somewhere just here, by us," he said.
"I must see. Wait a moment. I'll strike a
light."</p>

<p>He drew out his match-box and struck a match,
protecting the tiny flame between his hands.
Then he bent down, searching the uneven ground
at their feet. The flame went out.</p>

<p>"I wish I had a lantern," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Maurice," Lily said, "let us go back to the
inn."</p>

<p>"What! and leave this child out here in the
night. I tell you there is a child crying near
us."</p>

<p>He spoke almost angrily.</p>

<p>"Let us go back, Maurice."</p>

<p>He stood for a moment as if uncertain.</p>

<p>"You think&mdash;" he began, then he stopped. She
took his hand and led him towards the village in
silence. As they reached the inn door, the faint
light from the coffee-room encircled them.
Maurice was white to the lips. He looked at
Lily without speaking, and he was trembling.</p>

<p>"Wasn't there anything?" he whispered. "Is
it here too? Can't you keep it away?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Lily said nothing. She opened the inn door.
Maurice stepped into the passage, heavily, almost
like a drunken man. And this was the first night
of their honeymoon.</p>

<p>The incident of the moor threw Maurice back
into the old misery from which he had emerged
for a brief moment, and, indeed, plunged him into
an abyss of despair such as he had never known
before. For now he had sincerely hoped for salvation,
and his hope had been frustrated. He had
clung to a belief that Lily's love, Lily's companionship
might avail to rescue him from the phantom,
or the reality, that was destroying his power,
shattering his manhood. The belief was dashed
from him, and he sank deeper in the sea of terror.
They stayed on for a while in this Sleepy Hollow,
but Maurice no longer felt its peace. Remote as
it was, cloistered in the rolling moors, the cry of
the child penetrated to it, making it the very
centre, the very core of all things hideous and
terrible. Even the silence of the village, its aloofness
from the world, became hateful to Maurice.
For they seemed to emphasise and to concentrate
the voice that pierced more keenly in silence, that
sounded more horrible in solitude.</p>

<p>"I cannot stay here," he said to Lily. "Let us
go back. I will take up my work again. I will
try to throw myself into it as I did when I was a
student. I shut out the living cry then, I will
shut out the dead cry now. For you&mdash;you cannot
help me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked at her while he spoke almost contemptuously,
almost as one looks at some woman
whose courage or whose faith one has tried and
found wanting.</p>

<p>"You cannot help me," he repeated.</p>

<p>Secretly he felt a cruel desire to sting Lily into
passion, to rouse her to some demonstration of
anger against his cowardice in thus taunting her
love and devotion. But she said nothing, only
looked at him with eyes that had become strangely
steadfast, and full of the quiet light of a great
calm and patience.</p>

<p>"D'you say nothing?" he said.</p>

<p>"If you wish to go, Maurice, let us go."</p>

<p>He had got up and was standing by the low
window that looked across the moor.</p>

<p>"Don't you see," he said, "that I am going
mad in this place? And you do nothing. Why
did I ever think that you could help me?"</p>

<p>"Try to think so still."</p>

<p>She, too, got up, followed him to the window
and put her two hands on his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the time has not come yet," she said.</p>

<p>Suddenly he took her hands in his and pushed
her a little way from him, so that he could look
clearly into her face.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? What can you mean?"
he said. "Sometimes I think you have some
secret that you keep from me, some purpose that
I know nothing of. You look as if&mdash;as if you were
waiting for something; were expectant; I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
know&mdash;" he broke off, "After all what does it
matter? Only let us go from here. Let us get
home. I hate that stretch of moorland. At
night it is full of bewailing and misery."</p>

<p>He shuddered although the warm spring sunshine
was pouring in at the window. Then he
turned and left the room without another word.
Lily stood still for a moment, with her eyes turned
in the direction of the door. Her cheeks burned
with a slight blush and her lips were half opened.</p>

<p>"If he only knew what I am waiting for!" she
murmured to herself. "Will it ever come?"</p>

<p>She sank down on the broad, old-fashioned
window seat, and leaned her cheek against the
leaded panes of glass. The bees were humming
outside. She listened to their music. It was dull
and dreamy, heavy like a golden noon in summer
time. And then the white lids fell over her eyes,
and the hum of the bees faded from her ears, and
she heard another music that made her woman's
heart leap up, she heard the first tiny murmur
of a new-born child.</p>

<p>It was sweeter than the hum of bees. It was
sweeter than the soul the lute gave up to the ears
of Nature when Orpheus touched the strings. It
was so sweet that tears came stealing from under
Lily's eyelids and dropped down upon her clasped
hands. She sat there motionless till the twilight
came over the moor, and Maurice entered, white
and weary, to ask impatiently of what she was
dreaming.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>As Maurice wished it, they returned the next
day to Brayfield and settled into the house
that was to be their home. It stood on a
low cliff overlooking the sea; a broad green
lawn, on which during the season a band played
and people promenaded, lay in front of it.
Beyond, the waves danced in the sunshine. The
situation of the house was almost absurdly cheerful,
and the house itself was new and prettily
furnished. But the life into which Lily entered
was strangely at variance with the surroundings,
strangely antagonistic to the brightness of the sea,
the sweetness of the air, the holiday gaiety that
pervaded the little town in the summer. For work
did not abolish, did not even lull the sound of
the voice that pursued Maurice with an inexorable
persistence. It was obvious that on his return
home after the honeymoon, he made a tremendous
effort to get the better of his enemy. He
called up all his manhood, all his strength of
character. He refused to hear the voice. When it
cried in his ears, he went to sit with Lily, and
plunged into conversation on subjects that interested
them both. He made her play to him, or
sing to him in the twilight. He read aloud to her.
This was at night. By day he worked unremittingly.
When he was not driving to see patients
he laboured to increase his knowledge of medicine.
He pursued the most subtle investigations into
the causes of obscure diseases, and specially
directed his enquiries towards the pathology of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the brain. He analysed the multitudinous developments
of madness and traced them back to their
beginnings; and when, as was often the case, he
discovered that the mad man or woman whose malady
was laid bare to him had inherited this curse of
humanity, he smiled with a momentary thrill of
joy. His ancestors on both sides of the family
had been sane. Yet one of the commonest, most
invariable delusions of the insane was the imaginary
idea that they were pursued by voices, ordering
them to do this or that, suggesting crimes to
them or weeping in their ears over some tragedy
of the past. Maurice knew that the mind which
does not inherit a legacy of insanity may yet be
overturned by some terrible incident, by a great
shock, or by an unexpected bereavement. But
surely such a mind would be aware of its transformation,
even as a man who, from an accident,
becomes disfigured is aware of the alteration of
his face from beauty to desolation. Maurice was
not aware that his mind had been transformed.
Deliberately, calmly, he asked himself, "Am I
insane?" Deliberately, calmly, his soul answered,
"No." Yet the cry of the child rang in his ears,
pursued his goings out and comings in, filled his
days with lamentation, and his nights with horror.</p>

<p>Then, leaving the subject of madness, Maurice
began to institute a close investigation into the
subject of alleged hauntings of human beings
by apparitions and by sounds. He read of
the actress, whose lover, who had slain himself
in despair at her cruelty, remained for ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
with her, manifesting his presence, although invisible,
by cries, curses, and clappings of the
hands. He read of the clergyman who was
haunted by the footsteps of his murdered sweetheart,
which even ascended the pulpit stairs behind
him, and pattered furtively about him when
he knelt to pray for pardon of his sin. He filled
his mind with visionary terrors, but they seemed
remote or even ridiculous to him, and he said to
himself that they were the clever inventions of
imaginative people. They were worked up.
They were moulded into conventional stories.
They pleased the magazines of their time. He
alone was really haunted of all men in the world,
so far as he knew. And then a great and greedy
desire came upon him to meet some other man
in a like case, to hear from live lips the true and
undecorated history of a despair like his own,
one of those bald and terse narratives which
pierce the imagination of the hearer like a sword,
with no tinselled scabbard of exaggeration and
of lies. He wondered whether upon the earth a
man walked in a darkness similar to that which
fell round him like a veil. He wondered whether
he was unique, even as he felt. Sometimes he
caught himself looking furtively at a harmless
stranger, a bright girl tanned by the sea, or a lad
just back from a fishing excursion to Raynor's
Bay, and saying to himself low and drearily:
"Does any spirit trouble you, I wonder? Does
any spirit cry to you in the night?" But neither<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
his work, his excursions of the imagination, nor
the presence of Lily in his house, availed to
cleanse the life of Maurice from the stain of
sound, that ever widened and spread upon it.
He fought for freedom for a while, strenuously,
with all his heart and soul. But the lost battle
left him with his energies exhausted, his courage
broken. One night he said to Lily:</p>

<p>"Do you know all I have been doing since we
came back here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Maurice, I know."</p>

<p>"And that it has all been in vain," he said,
with a passion of bitterness that he could not try
to conceal.</p>

<p>"That too I understand, Maurice&mdash;I knew it
would be in vain."</p>

<p>He looked at her almost as at an enemy, for
his heart was so full of misery, his mind was so
worn with weariness, that he began to lose the
true appreciation of human relations, and to confuse
the beauty near him with the ugliness that
companioned him so closely.</p>

<p>"You knew it? What do you mean?" he said.
"How could you know it?"</p>

<p>"I felt it, Maurice; do not try any longer to
work out alone your own redemption."</p>

<p>"You can say that to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for I believe that it is useless&mdash;you will
fail."</p>

<p>He set his lips together and said nothing. But
a frown distorted his face slowly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Leave your redemption to God. Oh, Maurice,
leave it," Lily said, and there were tears in her
eyes. "If this cry of the dead child is his punishment
to you it must&mdash;it will&mdash;endure so long
as he pleases. Your efforts cannot still it now.
You yourself told me so once."</p>

<p>"I told you?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;for the dead are beyond our hands and
our lips. We cannot clasp them. We cannot
kiss them. We cannot speak to them."</p>

<p>"But they can speak to us and mock us.
You are right. I can't still the cry&mdash;I can't!
Then it's all over with me!"</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a sob, Maurice flung himself
down. He felt as if something within him
snapped, and as if straightway a dissolution of
all the man in him succeeded this rupture of the
spirit. Careless of the pride of man, before the
world and even in his own home, he gave himself
up to a despair that was too weak to be frantic,
too complete to be angry; a despair that no longer
strove but yielded, that lay down in the dust and
wept. Then, presently, raising his head and seeing
Lily, in whose eyes were tears of pity,
Maurice was seized with an enmity against her,
unreasonably wicked, but suddenly so vehement
that he did not try to resist it.</p>

<p>"You have broken me," he said. "You have
told me that there is no redemption, that I am
in the hands of God, who persecutes me. You
have told me the truth and made me hate you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maurice!"</p>

<p>The cry came from her lips faintly, but there
was the ring of anguish in it.</p>

<p>"It is so," he repeated doggedly. "And, indeed,
I believe that you have added to the weight
of my burden. Since we have been married the
persecution has increased. Once, when I was
alone, I could bear it. Now you are here I cannot
bear it. The child hates you. When you are
near&mdash;in the night&mdash;its cry is so intense that I
wonder you can sleep. Yet I hear your quiet
breathing. You say you love me. Then why
are you so calm? Why do you tell me to trust?
Why do you hint that I may yet find peace, and
then tell me to cease from working for my own
peace? You don't love me, you laugh at my
trouble. You despise me."</p>

<p>He burst out of the room almost like a man
demented.</p>

<p>It might be supposed that Lily, who loved him,
would have been overwhelmed by this ecstasy
of anger against her. But there was something
that sheathed her heart from death. She might
be wounded, she might suffer; but she looked beyond
the present time, over the desert of her
fate to roses of a future that Maurice, in his misery,
could not see, in his self-engrossment could
not divine. There is no living thing that understands
how to wait, that can feel the beauty
of patience, as a woman understands and feels.
The curious depth of calm in Lily which irritated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Maurice was created by a faith, half religious,
half unreasoning, wholly strong and determined,
such as no man ever knows in quite the
same fullness as a woman. It is such a perfection
of faith which gilds the silences in which the
souls of many women wait, surrounded by the
clouds of apparently shattered lives, but conscious
that there is a great outcome, obscure and remote,
but certain as the purpose which beats forever
in Creation.</p>

<p>From that day Maurice no longer kept up a
pretence of energy, or a simulation of even tolerable
happiness in his home. The idea that the
spirit of the dead child was stirred to an intense
disquietude by his connection with Lily, and that,
consequently, his marriage had deepened his punishment,
grew in him until at length it became
fixed. He brooded over it for hours together, his
ears full of that eternal complaining. He began
to feel that by linking himself with Lily he had
added to his original sin, that his wedding had
been a ceremony almost criminal, and that if he
had scourged himself by living ascetically, and by
putting rigorously away from him all earthly happiness,
he might at last have laid the child to rest
and found peace and forgiveness himself. And
this fixed idea led him to shut Lily entirely out
from his heart. He looked upon the fate of her
being with him in the house as irrevocable. But
he resolved that he ought to disassociate himself
from her as far as possible, and, without explaining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
further to her the thought that now possessed
him, he ceased to sit with her, ceased to walk out
with her.</p>

<p>After dinner at night he retired to his study
leaving her alone in the drawing-room. He let
her go up to bed without bidding her good-night.
When he was obliged to be with her at meals
he maintained for the most part an obstinate
silence.</p>

<p>Yet the cry of the child grew louder. The
spirit of the child was not mollified. Its persecution
continued and seemed to him to grow
more persistent with each passing day.</p>

<p>What else could he do? How could he separate
himself more completely from Lily?</p>

<p>Canon Alston came one day to solve this problem
for him. The Canon had resolved on taking
a holiday, and being no lover of solitude in his
pleasures, he wished to persuade Maurice to become
a grass widower for three weeks.</p>

<p>"Can you let Lily go?" he said. "I know it
is a shame to leave you alone, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, surprised at the sudden brightness
that had come into Maurice's usually pale and
grave face. Maurice saw his astonishment and
hastened to allay it.</p>

<p>"I shall miss Lily of course," he began. "Still,
if you want her, and she is anxious to go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have not mentioned it to her," the Canon
said.</p>

<p>And at this moment Lily came into the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
The project was laid before her. She hesitated,
looking from her father to her husband. Her
perplexity seemed to both the men curiously
acute, even to Maurice who was on fire to hear
her decision. The prospect of solitude was sweet
to his tormented heart now that he was possessed
by the fancy that Lily's presence intensified his
martyrdom. Yet Lily's obvious disturbance of
mind surprised him. The two courses open to
her were really so simple that there seemed no
possible reason why she should look upon the
taking of one of them as a momentous matter.</p>

<p>"Well, Lily, what do you say?" the Canon
asked, after a pause. "Will you come with
me?"</p>

<p>"But Maurice&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maurice permits it, and I want you."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I had not meant to leave home at present,
father, not till after&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>"Till after what, my dear?" enquired the
Canon.</p>

<p>She made no answer.</p>

<p>"Lily," Maurice said, trying to make his voice
cool and indifferent, "I think you ought to go.
It will do you good. Do not mind me. I shall
manage very well for a little while."</p>

<p>"You would rather I went, Maurice?"</p>

<p>"I think we ought not to let your father go on
his holiday alone."</p>

<p>"I will go," she said quietly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>So it was arranged. The Canon was jubilant
at the prospect of his daughter's company, and
asked her where they should travel.</p>

<p>"What do you say to the English Lakes, Lily?"
he asked, "they are lovely at this time of year,
and the rush of the tourist season has scarcely
begun. Shall we go there?"</p>

<p>"Wherever you like, father," she said.</p>

<p>The Canon was feeling too gay to notice the
preoccupation of her manner, the ungirlish gravity
of her voice. That day, in the evening, when she
was at dinner with Maurice, Lily said:</p>

<p>"You lived near the Lakes once, didn't you,
Maurice?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said.</p>

<p>"What was the name of the valley?"</p>

<p>He told her.</p>

<p>"And the house?"</p>

<p>"End Cottage. It was close to the waterfall.
I hate it," he added almost fiercely. "It was
there that I first heard&mdash;but I have told you."</p>

<p>He relapsed into silence and sent away the food
on his plate untasted. Lily glanced across at him.
But she said nothing more. And Maurice was
struck by the consciousness that she took his
strangeness strangely, with a lack of curiosity, a
lack of protestation unlike a woman; almost for
the first time since they were married he was
moved to wonder how much she loved him, indeed
whether she still loved him at all. He had got
up from the dinner table and stood with one hand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
leaning upon it as he looked steadily, with his
heavy and hunted eyes, across at Lily.</p>

<p>"Are you glad to go with the Canon?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I am quite ready to go," she said quietly.</p>

<p>"You don't mind leaving me?"</p>

<p>"I think you wish me to leave you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I do," he said, watching her to see if
she winced at the words.</p>

<p>But her face was still and calm.</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"Then it is better for me to go for a little while
than to stay."</p>

<p>"For a little while," he repeated, "yes."</p>

<p>He turned and went slowly out of the room,
and suddenly his face was distorted. For, in the
darkness of the hall, he heard the child crying and
lamenting. He stopped and listened to it like a
man who resolutely faces his destruction. And,
as so many times, he asked himself; "Is this a
freak of my imagination, a trick of my nerves?"
No, the sound was surely real, was close to him.
It thrilled in his ears keenly. He could not doubt
its reality. Yet he acknowledged to himself that
he could not actually locate it. Only in that respect
did it differ from other sounds of earth. As
he stood in the half darkness, listening, a horror,
greater than he had ever felt before, came over
him. The cry seemed to him menacing, no longer
merely a cry for sympathy, for assistance, no
longer merely the cry of a helpless creature in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
pain. He turned white and sick, and clapped
his two hands to his ears. And just as he did so
the dining-room door opened and Lily came out,
a thin stream of light following her and falling
upon Maurice. He started at the vision of her
and at the revealing illumination. His nerves
were quivering. His whole body seemed to vibrate.</p>

<p>"Don't come near me," he cried out to Lily.
"It is worse since you are with me. Your presence
makes my danger. Ah!"</p>

<p>And with a cry he dashed into his study, banging
the door behind him, as if he fled from her.</p>

<hr class="hr1" />

<p>A few days later Maurice stood at the garden
gate and helped Lily into the carriage that was to
take her to the station. A summons to a patient
prevented him from seeing her and the Canon off
on their journey northwards. Just before Lily
put her foot on the step she stopped and wavered.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," she said.</p>

<p>She ran back into the little house which had
been her home since she was married. Maurice
supposed that she had forgotten something. But
she only peeped into her bedroom, into the gay
drawing-room, into Maurice's den. And as she
looked at this last little chamber, at the books, the
ruffled writing-table, the pipes ranged against the
wall, her photograph standing in a silver frame
upon the mantelpiece, her eyes filled with tears,
and there was a stricken feeling at her heart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lily, you will miss the train," Maurice called
to her.</p>

<p>She hurried out, got into the carriage and was
driven away, wondering why she had gone back
to take a last glance at her home, why she had
scarcely been able to see it for her tears.</p>

<p>That evening Maurice returned from his round
of visits in a curious state of excitement and of
anticipation, mingled with nervous dread. He felt
as if the eyes of the dead child were upon all his
doings, as if the mind of the dead child pondered
every act of his, as if the brain of the dead child
were busy about his life, as if the soul of the dead
child concerned itself for ever with his soul, which
it had secretly dedicated to a loneliness assured
now by the departure of Lily. By living alone,
even for a few weeks, was he not in a measure
obeying the desire of the little spirit, which possessed
his fate like some inexorable Providence?
If so, dare he not hope for an interval of peace,
for that stillness after which he longed with an
anxiety that was like a physical pain?</p>

<p>He entered his house. Twilight was falling,
and the hall, in which on the previous night the
child had complained in so grievous a manner,
was shadowy. He stood there and listened. He
heard the distant wash of the sea, the voices of
two servants talking together behind the swing
door that led to the kitchen. No sound mingled
with the sea, or with the chattering voices.
Slowly he ascended the stairs and entered the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
bedroom, in which Lily had slept quietly, while
he, by her side, endured the persecution of the
child. The blinds were up. The dying daylight
crept slowly from the room, making an
exit as furtive and suppressed as that of one
who steals from a death chamber. Maurice sat
down upon the bed and again listened for a long
time.</p>

<p>He was conscious of the sense of relief which
comes upon a man who, through some sudden
act, has removed from his shoulders a terrible
burden. He took this present silence to himself
as a reward. But would it last? Opening the
window he leaned out to hear the sea more plainly.
All living voices, whether of Nature or of man,
were beautiful to him, they had come to make his
silence.</p>

<p>A servant knocked at the door. Maurice went
down to dine. He passed the late evening as
usual in his study. He slept calmly. He woke&mdash;to
silence. Did not this silence confirm his
fixed idea that his marriage with Lily had vexed
that wakeful spirit, had troubled that unquiet soul
of the child? Maurice, wrapped in a beautiful
peace, felt that it did. And, as the silent lovely
days, the silent lovely nights passed on he came
gradually to a fixed resolve.</p>

<p>Lily must not return to him, must not live with
him again.</p>

<p>He pondered for a long time how he was to
compass their further separation. And, at length,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
he sat down and wrote a letter to Lily telling her
the exact truth.</p>

<p>"Think me cruel, selfish," he wrote at the end
of his letter. "I am cruel. I am selfish. Despair
has made me so. The fear of madness has
made me so. I must have peace. I must and
will have it, at whatever cost."</p>

<p>He sent this letter to the <i>poste restante</i> at
Windermere, as Lily had directed. She and her
father were moving about in the Lake district, and
did not know from day to day where they might
be. He received a reply within a week. It
reached him at breakfast time, and, happening to
glance at the postmark before he opened it, his face
suddenly flushed and his heart beat with violence.
For the letter came from that lonely village in
that sequestered mountain valley in which he had
once lived, in which he had first heard the cry of
the child. What chance had led Lily's steps there?
Maurice read the letter eagerly. It was very gentle,
very submissive. And there was one strange
passage in it:</p>

<p>"I understand that you are at peace," Lily
wrote. "Yet the child is not at peace. It is
crying still. You will ask me how I know that.
Do not ask me now. Some day I shall send for
you and tell you. When I send for you, if it is
by day or night, promise that you will come to
me. I claim this promise from you. And now
good-bye for a time. My father is very unhappy
about us. But he trusts me completely, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
have told him that you and I must be apart, but
only for a time. I shall not write to you again
till I send for you. Even my letter may disturb
your peace and I would give up my life to give
you peace."</p>

<p>There was no allusion in the letter to the reason
which had led Lily and her father to the out-of-the-way
valley which had seen the dawn of
Maurice's despair. And Maurice was greatly
puzzled. Again there came over him a curious
conviction that Lily had some secret from him,
some secret connected with his fate, and that she
was waiting for the arrival of some day, fixed in
her mind, on which to make a revelation of her
knowledge to him. This mention of an eventual
summons, "by day or night." What could it
mean otherwise? Maurice read the letter again
and again. Its last words touched him by their
perfect unselfishness and also by their feminine
romance. He had a moment's thought of the
many emotional stories Lily had read. "She
lives in one now," he said to himself. And then, as
usual, he became self-engrossed, saw only his own
life, possibly touched for ever with a light of peace.</p>

<p>The Canon returned alone. He met Maurice
gravely, almost sternly.</p>

<p>"I trust my child entirely," he said. "She
has told me that for a time you must live apart.
She has made me promise not to ask you the
reason of this separation. I don't ask it, but if
you&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>His voice broke and he turned away for a moment.
Then he said:</p>

<p>"Lily remains in the place from which she
wrote to you."</p>

<p>"She is going to live there!" Maurice exclaimed.</p>

<p>"For the present, I could not persuade her
otherwise. Her old nurse, Mrs. Whitehead, is
going up to be with her. I cannot understand
all this."</p>

<p>The old man cast his eyes searchingly upon
Maurice.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;?" he began, then, remembering his
promise to his daughter, he stopped short.</p>

<p>"We will talk no more about this," he said
slowly. "No more."</p>

<p>He bade Maurice good-bye and returned, sorrowful,
to the Rectory.</p>

<p>Lily kept her word. Maurice had no more
letters from her. He only heard of her from the
Canon, and knew that she remained in that beautiful
and terrible valley, which he remembered so
vividly and hated so ardently. Meanwhile he
dwelt in a peace that was strange to him. The
little voice had gone out of his life. The cry of
the child was hushed. Often, in the past, Maurice
had contemplated the coming of this exquisite
silence, but he had always imagined it as a gradual
approach. He had fancied that if the lamentation
of the child ever died out of his haunted life
it would fade away as the sound of the sea fades<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
on a long strand when the whispering tide goes
down. Day by day, night by night, her crying
would grow less poignant, less distinct in a long
diminuendo, as if the restless spirit withdrew
slowly farther and farther away, till the cry became
a whisper, then a broken murmur, then&mdash;nothing.
This abrupt cessation of persecution,
this violent change from something that had
seemed like menace to perfect immunity from
trouble, was a fact that Maurice had never thought
of as a possibility. He had grown to believe that
Lily's presence in his home intensified the terror
from which he suffered, certainly. But he had
never supposed that her removal from him would
lay the spirit entirely to rest. And she said that
it was not at rest. How could she know that?
And if it were not at rest, in what region was it
pursuing its weird activity? Whither had it
gone? He wondered long and deeply. And
then he resolved to wonder no more. Peace had
come to him at last. He would not break it by
questioning the reason of it. He would accept it
blindly, joyfully. Man blots the sunshine out of
life by asking "Why?"</p>

<p>Time passed on. Brayfield had gossiped, marvelled
and sunk into a sort of apathy of unrewarded
and quiescent curiosity. The Canon pursued
his life at the Rectory. Maurice visited
his patients and continued unremittingly his
medical researches. The immunity he now enjoyed
gradually wrought a great change in him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
He emerged from prison into the outer air. His
health rapidly improved. His heavy eyes grew
bright. His mind was active and alert. He was
a new man. The darkness faded round him. He
saw the light at last. For the silence endured.
And at last he even forgot to listen, at dawn or
in the silent hours of the night, for the cry of the
child. Even the memory of it began to grow
faint within his heart. So rapidly does man forget
his troubles when he still has youth and the
years are not heavy on him.</p>

<p>Yet Maurice often thought of Lily. And now
that he was no longer bowed under the tyranny
of a shattered nervous system he felt a new tenderness
for her. He recalled her devotion and no
longer linked her with his persecution. He remembered
her unselfishness. He wished her back
again. And then&mdash;he remembered all his misery,
and that, with her, it went. And his selfishness
said to him&mdash;it is better so. And his mental
cowardice whispered to him&mdash;your safety is in
your solitude. And he put the memory of Lily's
love and of the beauty of her nature from
him.</p>

<p>So his silent autumn passed by. And his
silent winter came. One day, in a December frost,
he met the Canon, muffled up to the chin and on
his way to see Miss Bigelow, who professed herself
once again <i>in extremis</i>. They stopped in the
snow and spoke a few commonplace words, but
Maurice thought he observed a peculiar furtiveness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
in the old man's manner, a hint of some suppressed
excitement in his voice.</p>

<p>"How is Lily?" Maurice asked.</p>

<p>"Fairly well," the Canon said.</p>

<p>"She is still at the inn?"</p>

<p>"No, she lately moved into a little house further
up the valley."</p>

<p>"Further up the valley," Maurice said. "But
there's only one other house in that direction. I
have been there you know," he added hastily.</p>

<p>"Lily told me you had stayed there."</p>

<p>"Well, but&mdash;" Maurice persisted, "there is only
one house, a private house."</p>

<p>"They have been building up there," the Canon
said evasively. "Houses are springing up. It is
a pity. Good-night."</p>

<p>And he turned and walked away. Maurice
stood looking after him. So they had been building
in the valley, and End Cottage no longer possessed
the distinction of being the finale of man
in that Arcadia of woods and streams, and rugged
hills on which the clouds brooded, from which
the rain came like a mournful pilgrim, to weep
over the gentle shrine of nature.</p>

<p>So they had been building in the valley.</p>

<p>Maurice made his way home. His mind was
full of memories.</p>

<p>The close of the year drew on. It was a bad
season, a cruel season for the poor. Men went
about saying to one another that it was a hard
winter. The papers were full of reports of abnormal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
frosts, of tremendous falls of snow, of ice-bound
rivers and trains delayed. There were
deaths from cold. The starving died off like
flies, under hedges by roadsides, in the fireless
attics of towns. Comfortable and well-to-do persons
talked vigorously of the delights of an old-fashioned
Christmas. The doctors had many
patients. Among them Maurice was very busy.
His talent had monopolised Brayfield and his
time was incessantly occupied. He scarcely noticed
Christmas. For even on that day he was
full of work. Several people managed to be very
ill among the plum puddings. The year died and
was buried. The New Year dawned, and still the
evil weather continued. In early January Maurice
came down one morning to find by his plate
a letter written in a hand of old age, straggling
and complicated. It proved to be from Mrs.
Whitehead, Lily's old nurse; and it contained
that summons of which Lily had spoken long ago
in her letter to her husband. Lily was ill and
wished to see Maurice at once. The letter, though
involved, was urgent.</p>

<p>Maurice laid it down. There was a date on it
but no name of a house. By the date Maurice
saw that the letter had been delayed in transit.
Blizzards, snow-storms, had been responsible for
many such delays. He got up from the table.
At that moment there was no hesitation in his
mind. He would go to Lily at once, as fast as
rail could carry him. In a few moments his luggage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
was packed. Within an hour he was on his
way to the station. He stopped the carriage at
the Rectory and asked to see the Canon for a
moment. The servant, looking reproachful, told
him her master had started three days before to
see "Miss Lily," who was ill.</p>

<p>"Miss Lily," Maurice said. "You mean Mrs.
Dale. I am on my way to see her too. What is
the matter? They do not tell me."</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir," the servant said, softening
a little on learning that Maurice was going north
to his wife.</p>

<p>Maurice drove on to the station.</p>

<p>In all his after life he never could forget his
white journey. It seemed to him as if nature
gathered herself together to delay him, to turn
him from his purpose of obeying the summons of
Lily. Even the line from Brayfield to London
was blocked, and when at length Maurice reached
London he found the great city staggering under
a burden of snow that rendered its features unrecognisable.
All traffic was practically suspended.
He missed train after train, and when he
drove at last into Euston Station and expressed
his intention of going north by the night mail the
porter shook his head and drew a terrible picture
of that arctic region.</p>

<p>"Most of the lines are blocked, sir," he said, "or
will be. It's a-coming on for more snow."</p>

<p>"I can't help that," Maurice said. "I must go.
Label my luggage."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>The train was due to start at midnight. Maurice
had a lonely dinner at the station hotel.
While he ate in the gaily lighted coffee-room he
thought of Lily and of his coming journey. The
influence of the weather had surrounded it with a
curious romance such as English travel seldom affords.
Maurice was very susceptible to the mental
atmosphere engendered by outward circumstances,
and yielded more readily than the average
man to the wayward promptings of the faithful
spirit that nestles somewhere in almost every intellect.
He began to regard this white journey to
the ice-bound and rugged north with something of
a child's wide-eyed, half-delighted, half-alarmed anticipation.
He thought of the darkness, of the dangers
by the way, of the multitudes of lonely snow-wreathed
miles the train would have to cover; of
the increasing cold as they went higher and higher
up the land, of the early dawn over fells and stone
walls, of the grey light on the grey sea. Then he
listened to the strangely muffled roar of a London
hoarse with cold. And he shivered and had feelings
of a man bound on some tremendous and
novel quest. As he came out of the hotel the
wintry air met him and embraced him. He entered
the station, dull and sinister in the night,
with its haggard gas-lamps and arches yawning
to the snow. There were few passengers, and they
looked anxious. The train drew in. Maurice
had his carriage to himself. The porter wished
him good luck on his journey with the voice and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
manner of one clearly foreseeing imminent disaster
and death. The whistle sounded, and the train
glided, a long black and orange snake, into the
white wonder of the clouded night. Snow beat
upon the windows, incrusted with the filagree
work of frost, and as the speed of the train increased
the carriage filled with the persistent
music of an intense and sustained activity. This
music, and the thoughts of Maurice fought against
sleep. He leaned back with open eyes and listened
to the song of the train. Its monotony was
like the monotony of an irritable man, he thought,
always angry, always expressing his anger. Beneath
bridges, in tunnels, the anger was dashed
with ripples of fury, with spurts of brutalising
passion. And then the normal current of dull
temper flowed on again as before. Maurice
wished that the windows were not merely thick
white blinds completely shutting out the night.
He longed to see the storm in which they fled
towards greater storms, the country which they
spurned as they sprang northwards! Northwards!
And to that valley!</p>

<p>His thoughts went to his old life alone there,
to the coming into it of the haunting voice, to his
terror, his struggle, his flight southward. He had
never thought to return there. Yet now he fled
towards that place of memories, calm, sane,
cleansed of persecution, with his mind fortified,
and his heart steadily and calmly beating, unshaken
by the agonies of old. Was he the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
man? It seemed almost impossible. And now
Maurice said to himself again that perhaps after
all the cry of the child had been imagination, a
symptom of illness in him from which he had&mdash;perhaps
even through some obscure physical
change&mdash;recovered completely. Yet Lily had
believed in the cry and believed in the unquiet
spirit behind it. But women are romantic, credulous&mdash;</p>

<p>The train rocked in a rapture of motion.
Maurice drew his rugs more closely round him.
With the advance of night the cold grew more
deadly.</p>

<p>Towards morning the pace of the train incessantly
decreased. Huge masses of snow had
drifted upon the line. For a rising wind drove it
together under hedgerows and walls until expanding
upon the track, it impeded the progress of the
engines. Maurice let down a window and peered
out. He saw only snow, stationary or floating,
at rest in shadowy heaps that fled back in the
darkness, or falling in a veil before his eyes. It
seemed to him now as if a hand were stretched
out to stay his impetuous advance to Lily. The
train went slower and slower. At last, towards
morning, it stopped. A long and distracted
whistling pierced the air. There was a jerk, a
movement forward, then another stoppage.
They were snowed up in the middle of a desolate
stretch of country, with a blizzard raging round
them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>How many hours passed before they were released
Maurice never knew. He lay wrapped up
to the eyes, numbed and passive, of body,
but mentally travelling with an extraordinary
rapidity. At first he was in the valley. He
saw it, as he had seen it in old days, in snow,
its river ice-bound, its waterfall arrested in
the midst of an army of crystal spears. White
mountains rose round it to a low sky,
curved, like a bosom, in grey cloud shapes. The
air was sharp and silent, clearer than southern
air, a thing that seemed to hold itself alert in its
narrow prison on the edge of solitude. He heard
the bark of a dog on the hills, in search of the
starving sheep.</p>

<p>Then he came to one of those new houses of
which the Canon had spoken, and in it he found
Lily. She was pale, but he scarcely noticed that,
engrossed in the strangeness of finding her there.
For in the south he had never fully realised Lily
at home in the valley, walking on the desolate
narrow roads by day, sleeping in the shadow of
the hills by night. Now he began to realise her
there. Where would the house be? Near End
Cottage, perhaps in sight of the garden to which
he had stolen on that evil night to listen for the
voice of a bird!</p>

<p>After many hours the train was dug out of the
snow, and sped forward again in daylight.
Maurice slept a little, but uneasily. And now, when
he was awake, he began to be filled with an unreasonable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
apprehension, for which he accounted
by taking stock of the low temperature of his
body, and of the loss of vitality occasioned by
want of food and rest. He was seized with fear
as he came up into the north and saw vaguely
the moors around him, the snowy waves where
the white woods rippled up the flanks of the
white hills. He began to realise again his former
condition when his life was full of the lamentation
of the child. He began to feel as if he drew near
to that lamentation once more. Perhaps the
little sorrowful spirit had only deserted him to
return to the valley in which it first greeted him.
Perhaps it would come again to him there. He
might hear the cry from the garden of the cottage
as he hastened past.</p>

<p>He shuddered and cursed his wild fancies. But
they stayed with him through all the rest of the
journey, through all the delays and periods of
numb patience. And they increased upon him.
When at last he reached the dreary station by the
flat sandbanks, at which he changed into the
valley train, he was pale and careworn, and full of
alarm.</p>

<p>Very slowly the tiny train crawled up into the
heart of the hills as the darkness of the second
night came down. Maurice was the only passenger
in it. He felt like one alone in a lonely
world, fearing inhabitants unseen, but whose distant
presence he was aware of. Could Lily indeed
be here, beyond him in this desolation? It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
seemed impossible. But the child might be here,
wandering, a lost spirit, in this unutterable winter.
That would not be strange to him. And his soul
grew colder than his body. He could see nothing
from the window, but occasionally he heard the
dry tapping of twigs upon the glass, as the train
crept among the leafless woods. And this tapping
seemed to him to be the tiny fingers of the
child, feebly endeavouring to attract his attention.
He shrank away from the window to the centre of
the carriage.</p>

<p>At the last station in the valley the train
stopped. Maurice got out into the darkness, and
asked the guard the name of the house in which
Mrs. Dale lived.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Dale," he said, in the broad Cumberland
dialect, "Oh, she bides at End Cottage."</p>

<p>Maurice stared at his rugged face peering
above the round lamp which he held.</p>

<p>"End Cottage?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. The poor lady took it on a six
months' lease, but I hear she's&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Maurice had turned away with a muttered:</p>

<p>"I'll send up for the luggage."</p>

<p>He stumbled out into the white lane and
through the little village. One or two lads,
roughly dressed and sprinkled with snowflakes,
eyed him from the shelter of the inn porch. As
he moved past them, he heard their muttered comments.
He left the houses behind and found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
himself among snow-laden trees. End Cottage
was hidden in this narrow wood which was generally
full of the sound of the waterfall.</p>

<p>Now the waterfall was silent, motionless, a
dead thing in a rocky grave. Maurice saw a faint
and misty light among the bare trees. It came
from his old home, and now his hand touched the
white garden gate, prickly with ice. He pushed
it open and stole up the path till he reached the
little porch of the cottage. As he stood there
his heart beat hard and his breath fluttered in his
throat. It seemed to him that there must be some
strange and terrible meaning in Lily's presence
here. With a shaking hand he pulled at the bell.
He waited. No one came. He heard no step.
The silence was dense, even appalling. After a
long pause he turned the handle of the door,
opened it, and stood on the threshold of the cottage.
Instead of entering at once he waited,
listening for any sound of life within the house,
for the voices or footsteps of those inhabiting it.</p>

<p>Just so had he waited on a summer night long
ago, with the moon behind him and leaf-laden
trees. He listened, and, after a moment of profound
stillness, he heard&mdash;as he had heard in that
very place so long ago&mdash;the faint cry of a child.
It came from within the house, clear and distinct
though frail and feeble.</p>

<p>Involuntarily Maurice moved a step backward
into the snow. Horror overwhelmed him. The
dead child was here then with Lily, in his old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
abode. The spirit was not laid to rest. It had
only deserted him for a while to greet him again
here, to take up again here its eternal persecution;
and this resurrection appalled and unmanned him
more than all the persistent haunting of the past.
He was dashed from confidence to despair. The
little cry paralysed him, and he leaned against
the wall of the porch almost like a dying man.</p>

<p>And again he heard the cry of the child.</p>

<p>How live and how real it was! Maurice remembered
that he had said to himself that the cry
was a phantasy of the brain, an imaginary sound
vibrating from an afflicted body. And now his
intellect denied such a supposition; the cry came
from a thing that lived, although it lived in another
world. It seemed to summon him with a
strange insistence. Against his will, and walking
slowly as one in a trance, he moved forward up
the narrow stairway till he reached the room that
had been his old bedroom.</p>

<p>The cry came surely from within that room.
The dead child was shut in there. Yes, never before
had Maurice been able to locate the cry precisely.
Now he could locate it. With shaking
fingers he grasped the handle of the door. He
stood in a faint illumination, and the cry of the
child came louder to his ears. But there mingled
with it another cry, faint yet thrilling with joy:</p>

<p>"Maurice!"</p>

<p>He looked and saw Lily, white as a flower. She
was propped on pillows, and, stretching out her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
thin girl's arms, she held feebly towards Maurice
a tiny baby.</p>

<p>"Maurice&mdash;it is the child!" she whispered.</p>

<p>"The child!" he repeated hoarsely.</p>

<p>For an instant he believed that his fate was
sealed, that the spirit, which for so long had pursued
him with its lamenting, now manifested its
actual presence to his eyes. Then, in a flash, the
truth came upon him. He fell upon his knees by
the bedside and put out his arms for the child. He
held it. He felt its soft breath against his cheek.
A cooing murmur, as if of tiny happiness, came
from its parted lips. It turned its little face,
flushed like a rose, against the breast of Maurice,
and nestled to sleep upon his heart.</p>

<p>And Lily's hand touched him.</p>

<p>"I thought you would not come in time," she
said, as the nurse, at a sign from her, stole softly
from the room.</p>

<p>"In time?"</p>

<p>"To see me before&mdash;they say, you know,
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lily!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Hush! The child! Listen, dear. If I die,
take the child. It is your dead child, I think,
come to life through me. Yes, yes, it is the little
child that has cried for love so long. Redeem
your cruelty, oh, Maurice, redeem it to your child.
Give it your love. Give it your life. Give it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lily!" he said again. And there were tears
on his cheeks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"I gave myself to you for this, Maurice. I was
waiting for this. Do you understand me now?
You scarcely loved me, Maurice. But I loved
you. Let me think&mdash;in dying&mdash;that I have
brought you peace at last."</p>

<p>He could not speak. The mystery of woman,
the mystery of child was too near to him. Awe
came upon him and the terror of his own unworthiness,
rewarded&mdash;or punished&mdash;which was it?&mdash;by
such compassion, such self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>"When I left you," Lily murmured, and her
voice sounded thin and tired, "it seemed as if the
spirit of the child came with me, as if I, too, heard
its dead voice in the night, crying for its salvation,
for its relief from agony. But, Maurice, you cannot
hear it now. You will never hear it again&mdash;unless&mdash;unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>She fixed her eyes on him. They were growing
dim.</p>

<p>"God has given the dead to you again through
me," she faltered, "that you&mdash;may&mdash;redeem&mdash;redeem&mdash;your&mdash;sin."</p>

<p>She moved, and leaned against him, as if she
would gather him and the sleeping child into her
embrace. But she could not. She slipped back
softly, almost like a snowflake that falls and is
gone.</p>

<hr class="hr1" />

<p>Maurice Dale is a famous doctor now. He
lives with his daughter, who never leaves him and
whom he loves passionately. Many patients<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
throng to his consulting-room, but not one of
them suspects that the grave physician, deep down
in his heart, cherishes a strange belief&mdash;not based
upon science. This belief is connected with his
child. Secretly he thinks of her as of one risen
from the grave, come back to him from beyond
the gates of death.</p>

<p>The cry of the child is silent. Maurice never
hears it now. But he believes that could any
demon tempt him, even for one moment, to be
cruel to his little daughter, he would hear it
again. It would lament once more in the darkness,
would once more fill the silence with its
despair.</p>

<p>And then a dead woman would stir in her
grave.</p>

<p>For there are surely cries of earth that even the
dead can hear.</p>

<h2>HOW LOVE CAME TO PROFESSOR
GUILDEA.</h2>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>
<h2 class="hd1">HOW LOVE CAME TO PROFESSOR
GUILDEA.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dull</span> people often wondered how it came
about that Father Murchison and Professor
Frederic Guildea were intimate friends. The one
was all faith, the other all scepticism. The nature
of the Father was based on love. He
viewed the world with an almost childlike tenderness
above his long, black cassock; and his mild,
yet perfectly fearless, blue eyes seemed always
to be watching the goodness that exists in humanity,
and rejoicing at what they saw. The Professor,
on the other hand, had a hard face like a
hatchet, tipped with an aggressive black goatee
beard. His eyes were quick, piercing and irreverent.
The lines about his small, thin-lipped
mouth were almost cruel. His voice was harsh
and dry, sometimes, when he grew energetic, almost
soprano. It fired off words with a sharp
and clipping utterance. His habitual manner
was one of distrust and investigation. It was
impossible to suppose that, in his busy life, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
found any time for love, either of humanity in
general or of an individual.</p>

<p>Yet his days were spent in scientific investigations
which conferred immense benefits upon the
world.</p>

<p>Both men were celibates. Father Murchison
was a member of an Anglican order which forbade
him to marry. Professor Guildea had a
poor opinion of most things, but especially of
women. He had formerly held a post as lecturer
at Birmingham. But when his fame as a discoverer
grew he removed to London. There, at
a lecture he gave in the East End, he first met
Father Murchison. They spoke a few words.
Perhaps the bright intelligence of the priest appealed
to the man of science, who was inclined,
as a rule, to regard the clergy with some contempt.
Perhaps the transparent sincerity of this
devotee, full of common sense, attracted him.
As he was leaving the hall he abruptly asked the
Father to call on him at his house in Hyde Park
Place. And the Father, who seldom went into
the West End, except to preach, accepted the
invitation.</p>

<p>"When will you come?" said Guildea.</p>

<p>He was folding up the blue paper on which his
notes were written in a tiny, clear hand. The
leaves rustled drily in accompaniment to his
sharp, dry voice.</p>

<p>"On Sunday week I am preaching in the evening
at St. Saviour's, not far off," said the Father.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't go to church."</p>

<p>"No," said the Father, without any accent of
surprise or condemnation.</p>

<p>"Come to supper afterwards?"</p>

<p>"Thank you. I will."</p>

<p>"What time will you come?"</p>

<p>The Father smiled.</p>

<p>"As soon as I have finished my sermon. The
service is at six-thirty."</p>

<p>"About eight then, I suppose. Don't make
the sermon too long. My number in Hyde Park
Place is a hundred. Good-night to you."</p>

<p>He snapped an elastic band round his papers
and strode off without shaking hands.</p>

<p>On the appointed Sunday, Father Murchison
preached to a densely crowded congregation at
St. Saviour's. The subject of his sermon was
sympathy, and the comparative uselessness of
man in the world unless he can learn to love his
neighbour as himself. The sermon was rather
long, and when the preacher, in his flowing, black
cloak, and his hard, round hat, with a straight
brim over which hung the ends of a black cord,
made his way towards the Professor's house, the
hands of the illuminated clock disc at the Marble
Arch pointed to twenty minutes past eight.</p>

<p>The Father hurried on, pushing his way through
the crowd of standing soldiers, chattering women
and giggling street boys in their Sunday best.
It was a warm April night, and, when he reached
number 100, Hyde Park Place, he found the Professor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
bareheaded on his doorstep, gazing out
towards the Park railings, and enjoying the soft,
moist air, in front of his lighted passage.</p>

<p>"Ha, a long sermon!" he exclaimed. "Come
in."</p>

<p>"I fear it was," said the Father, obeying the
invitation. "I am that dangerous thing&mdash;an extempore
preacher."</p>

<p>"More attractive to speak without notes, if you
can do it. Hang your hat and coat&mdash;oh, cloak&mdash;here.
We'll have supper at once. This is the
dining-room."</p>

<p>He opened a door on the right and they entered
a long, narrow room, with a gold paper and
a black ceiling, from which hung an electric lamp
with a gold-coloured shade. In the room stood a
small oval table with covers laid for two. The
Professor rang the bell. Then he said,</p>

<p>"People seem to talk better at an oval table
than at a square one."</p>

<p>"Really. Is that so?"</p>

<p>"Well, I've had precisely the same party
twice, once at a square table, once at an oval
table. The first dinner was a dull failure, the
second a brilliant success. Sit down, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"How d'you account for the difference?" said
the Father, sitting down, and pulling the tail of
his cassock well under him.</p>

<p>"H'm. I know how you'd account for it."</p>

<p>"Indeed. How then?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>"At an oval table, since there are no corners,
the chain of human sympathy&mdash;the electric current,
is much more complete. Eh! Let me
give you some soup."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>The Father took it, and, as he did so, turned his
beaming blue eyes on his host. Then he smiled.</p>

<p>"What!" he said, in his pleasant, light tenor
voice. "You do go to church sometimes, then?"</p>

<p>"To-night is the first time for ages. And,
mind you, I was tremendously bored."</p>

<p>The Father still smiled, and his blue eyes
gently twinkled.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear!" he said, "what a pity!"</p>

<p>"But not by the sermon," Guildea added. "I
don't pay a compliment. I state a fact. The
sermon didn't bore me. If it had, I should have
said so, or said nothing."</p>

<p>"And which would you have done?"</p>

<p>The Professor smiled almost genially.</p>

<p>"Don't know," he said. "What wine d'you
drink?"</p>

<p>"None, thank you. I'm a teetotaller. In my
profession and <i>milieu</i> it is necessary to be one.
Yes, I will have some soda water. I think you
would have done the first."</p>

<p>"Very likely, and very wrongly. You wouldn't
have minded much."</p>

<p>"I don't think I should."</p>

<p>They were intimate already. The Father felt
most pleasantly at home under the black ceiling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
He drank some soda water and seemed to enjoy
it more than the Professor enjoyed his claret.</p>

<p>"You smile at the theory of the chain of
human sympathy, I see," said the Father.
"Then what is your explanation of the failure of
your square party with corners, the success of
your oval party without them?"</p>

<p>"Probably on the first occasion the wit of the
assembly had a chill on his liver, while on the
second he was in perfect health. Yet, you see, I
stick to the oval table."</p>

<p>"And that means&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very little. By the way, your omission of
any allusion to the notorious part liver plays in
love was a serious one to-night."</p>

<p>"Your omission of any desire for close human
sympathy in your life is a more serious one."</p>

<p>"How can you be sure I have no such desire?"</p>

<p>"I divine it. Your look, your manner, tell me
it is so. You were disagreeing with my sermon
all the time I was preaching. Weren't you?"</p>

<p>"Part of the time."</p>

<p>The servant changed the plates. He was a
middle-aged, blond, thin man, with a stony white
face, pale, prominent eyes, and an accomplished
manner of service. When he had left the room
the Professor continued,</p>

<p>"Your remarks interested me, but I thought
them exaggerated."</p>

<p>"For instance?"</p>

<p>"Let me play the egoist for a moment. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
spend most of my time in hard work, very hard
work. The results of this work, you will allow,
benefit humanity."</p>

<p>"Enormously," assented the Father, thinking
of more than one of Guildea's discoveries.</p>

<p>"And the benefit conferred by this work, undertaken
merely for its own sake, is just as great
as if it were undertaken because I loved my fellow
man and sentimentally desired to see him
more comfortable than he is at present. I'm as
useful precisely in my present condition of&mdash;in
my present non-affectional condition&mdash;as I should
be if I were as full of gush as the sentimentalists
who want to get murderers out of prison, or to
put a premium on tyranny&mdash;like Tolstoi&mdash;by
preventing the punishment of tyrants."</p>

<p>"One may do great harm with affection; great
good without it. Yes, that is true. Even <i>le bon
motif</i> is not everything, I know. Still I contend
that, given your powers, you would be far more
useful in the world with sympathy, affection for
your kind, added to them than as you are. I believe
even that you would do still more splendid
work."</p>

<p>The Professor poured himself out another glass
of claret.</p>

<p>"You noticed my butler?" he said.</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"He's a perfect servant. He makes me perfectly
comfortable. Yet he has no feeling of
liking for me. I treat him civilly. I pay him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
well. But I never think about him, or concern
myself with him as a human being. I know
nothing of his character except what I read of it
in his last master's letter. There are, you may
say, no truly human relations between us. You
would affirm that his work would be better done
if I had made him personally like me as man&mdash;of
any class&mdash;can like man&mdash;of any other class?"</p>

<p>"I should, decidedly."</p>

<p>"I contend that he couldn't do his work better
than he does it at present."</p>

<p>"But if any crisis occurred?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Any crisis, change in your condition. If you
needed his help, not only as a man and a butler,
but as a man and a brother? He'd fail you then,
probably. You would never get from your servant
that finest service which can only be
prompted by an honest affection."</p>

<p>"You have finished?"</p>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>"Let us go upstairs then. Yes, those are good
prints. I picked them up in Birmingham when
I was living there. This is my workroom."</p>

<p>They came into a double room lined entirely
with books, and brilliantly, rather hardly, lit by
electricity. The windows at one end looked on
to the Park, at the other on to the garden of a
neighbouring house. The door by which they
entered was concealed from the inner and smaller
room by the jutting wall of the outer room, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
which stood a huge writing-table loaded with
letters, pamphlets and manuscripts. Between
the two windows of the inner room was a cage in
which a large, grey parrot was clambering, using
both beak and claws to assist him in his slow and
meditative peregrinations.</p>

<p>"You have a pet," said the Father, surprised.</p>

<p>"I possess a parrot," the Professor answered,
drily, "I got him for a purpose when I was making
a study of the imitative powers of birds, and
I have never got rid of him. A cigar?"</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>They sat down. Father Murchison glanced at
the parrot. It had paused in its journey, and,
clinging to the bars of its cage, was regarding
them with attentive round eyes that looked deliberately
intelligent, but by no means sympathetic.
He looked away from it to Guildea, who
was smoking, with his head thrown back, his
sharp, pointed chin, on which the small black
beard bristled, upturned. He was moving his
under lip up and down rapidly. This action
caused the beard to stir and look peculiarly aggressive.
The Father suddenly chuckled softly.</p>

<p>"Why's that?" cried Guildea, letting his chin
drop down on his breast and looking at his guest
sharply.</p>

<p>"I was thinking it would have to be a crisis
indeed that could make you cling to your butler's
affection for assistance."</p>

<p>Guildea smiled too.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're right. It would. Here he comes."</p>

<p>The man entered with coffee. He offered it
gently, and retired like a shadow retreating on a
wall.</p>

<p>"Splendid, inhuman fellow," remarked Guildea.</p>

<p>"I prefer the East End lad who does my errands
in Bird Street," said the Father. "I know all
his worries. He knows some of mine. We are
friends. He's more noisy than your man. He
even breathes hard when he is specially solicitous,
but he would do more for me than put the
coals on my fire, or black my square-toed boots."</p>

<p>"Men are differently made. To me the watchful
eye of affection would be abominable."</p>

<p>"What about that bird?"</p>

<p>The Father pointed to the parrot. It had got
up on its perch and, with one foot uplifted in an
impressive, almost benedictory, manner, was gazing
steadily at the Professor.</p>

<p>"That's the watchful eye of imitation, with a
mind at the back of it, desirous of reproducing
the peculiarities of others. No, I thought your
sermon to-night very fresh, very clever. But I
have no wish for affection. Reasonable liking, of
course, one desires," he tugged sharply at his
beard, as if to warn himself against sentimentality,&mdash;"but
anything more would be most irksome,
and would push me, I feel sure, towards
cruelty. It would also hamper one's work."</p>

<p>"I don't think so."</p>

<p>"The sort of work I do. I shall continue to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
benefit the world without loving it, and it will
continue to accept the benefits without loving
me. That's all as it should be."</p>

<p>He drank his coffee. Then he added, rather
aggressively:</p>

<p>"I have neither time nor inclination for sentimentality."</p>

<p>When Guildea let Father Murchison out, he
followed the Father on to the doorstep and stood
there for a moment. The Father glanced across
the damp road into the Park.</p>

<p>"I see you've got a gate just opposite you," he
said idly.</p>

<p>"Yes. I often slip across for a stroll to clear
my brain. Good-night to you. Come again
some day."</p>

<p>"With pleasure. Good-night."</p>

<p>The Priest strode away, leaving Guildea standing
on the step.</p>

<p>Father Murchison came many times again to
number one hundred Hyde Park Place. He had
a feeling of liking for most men and women
whom he knew, and of tenderness for all, whether
he knew them or not, but he grew to have a
special sentiment towards Guildea. Strangely
enough, it was a sentiment of pity. He pitied
this hard-working, eminently successful man of
big brain and bold heart, who never seemed depressed,
who never wanted assistance, who never
complained of the twisted skein of life or faltered
in his progress along its way. The Father pitied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Guildea, in fact, because Guildea wanted so little.
He had told him so, for the intercourse of the
two men, from the beginning, had been singularly
frank.</p>

<p>One evening, when they were talking together,
the Father happened to speak of one of the oddities
of life, the fact that those who do not want
things often get them, while those who seek them
vehemently are disappointed in their search.</p>

<p>"Then I ought to have affection poured upon
me," said Guildea, smiling rather grimly. "For
I hate it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps some day you will."</p>

<p>"I hope not, most sincerely."</p>

<p>Father Murchison said nothing for a moment.
He was drawing together the ends of the broad
band round his cassock. When he spoke he
seemed to be answering someone.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said slowly, "yes, that <i>is</i> my feeling&mdash;pity."</p>

<p>"For whom?" said the Professor.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, he understood. He did not
say that he understood, but Father Murchison
felt, and saw, that it was quite unnecessary to
answer his friend's question. So Guildea, strangely
enough, found himself closely acquainted with a
man&mdash;his opposite in all ways,&mdash;who pitied him.</p>

<p>The fact that he did not mind this, and scarcely
ever thought about it, shows perhaps as clearly
as anything could the peculiar indifference of
his nature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> Autumn evening, a year and a half after
Father Murchison and the Professor had first met,
the Father called in Hyde Park Place and enquired
of the blond and stony butler&mdash;his name was
Pitting&mdash;whether his master was at home.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Pitting. "Will you please
come this way?"</p>

<p>He moved noiselessly up the rather narrow
stairs, followed by the Father, tenderly opened
the library door, and in his soft, cold voice, announced:</p>

<p>"Father Murchison."</p>

<p>Guildea was sitting in an armchair, before a
small fire. His thin, long-fingered hands lay outstretched
upon his knees, his head was sunk down
on his chest. He appeared to be pondering
deeply. Pitting very slightly raised his voice.</p>

<p>"Father Murchison to see you, sir," he repeated.</p>

<p>The Professor jumped up rather suddenly and
turned sharply round as the Father came in.</p>

<p>"Oh," he said. "It's you, is it? Glad to see
you. Come to the fire."</p>

<p>The Father glanced at him and thought him
looking unusually fatigued.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't look well to-night," the Father said.</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"You must be working too hard. That lecture
you are going to give in Paris is bothering you?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit. It's all arranged. I could deliver
it to you at this moment verbatim. Well, sit
down."</p>

<p>The Father did so, and Guildea sank once more
into his chair and stared hard into the fire without
another word. He seemed to be thinking
profoundly. His friend did not interrupt him,
but quietly lit a pipe and began to smoke reflectively.
The eyes of Guildea were fixed upon the
fire. The Father glanced about the room, at the
walls of soberly bound books, at the crowded
writing-table, at the windows, before which hung
heavy, dark-blue curtains of old brocade, at the
cage, which stood between them. A green baize
covering was thrown over it. The Father wondered
why. He had never seen Napoleon&mdash;so
the parrot was named&mdash;covered up at night before.
While he was looking at the baize, Guildea
suddenly jerked up his head, and, taking his
hands from his knees and clasping them, said
abruptly:</p>

<p>"D'you think I'm an attractive man?"</p>

<p>Father Murchison jumped. Such a question
coming from such a man astounded him.</p>

<p>"Bless me!" he ejaculated. "What makes
you ask? Do you mean attractive to the opposite
sex?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's what I don't know," said the Professor
gloomily, and staring again into the fire. "That's
what I don't know."</p>

<p>The Father grew more astonished.</p>

<p>"Don't know!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>And he laid down his pipe.</p>

<p>"Let's say&mdash;d'you think I'm attractive, that
there's anything about me which might draw a&mdash;a
human being, or an animal, irresistibly to me?"</p>

<p>"Whether you desired it or not?"</p>

<p>"Exactly&mdash;or&mdash;no, let us say definitely&mdash;if I
did not desire it."</p>

<p>Father Murchison pursed up his rather full,
cherubic lips, and little wrinkles appeared about
the corners of his blue eyes.</p>

<p>"There might be, of course," he said, after a
pause. "Human nature is weak, engagingly weak,
Guildea. And you're inclined to flout it. I
could understand a certain class of lady&mdash;the
lion-hunting, the intellectual lady, seeking you.
Your reputation, your great name&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," Guildea interrupted, rather irritably&mdash;"I
know all that, I know."</p>

<p>He twisted his long hands together, bending
the palms outwards till his thin, pointed fingers
cracked. His forehead was wrinkled in a frown.</p>

<p>"I imagine," he said,&mdash;he stopped and coughed
drily, almost shrilly&mdash;"I imagine it would be very
disagreeable to be liked, to be run after&mdash;that is
the usual expression, isn't it&mdash;by anything one
objected to."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>And now he half turned in his chair, crossed
his legs one over the other, and looked at his
guest with an unusual, almost piercing interrogation.</p>

<p>"Anything?" said the Father.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well, anyone. I imagine nothing could
be more unpleasant."</p>

<p>"To you&mdash;no," answered the Father. "But&mdash;forgive
me, Guildea, I cannot conceive you permitting
such intrusion. You don't encourage
adoration."</p>

<p>Guildea nodded his head gloomily.</p>

<p>"I don't," he said, "I don't. That's just it.
That's the curious part of it, that I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off deliberately, got up and stretched.</p>

<p>"I'll have a pipe, too," he said.</p>

<p>He went over to the mantelpiece, got his pipe,
filled it and lighted it. As he held the match to
the tobacco, bending forward with an enquiring
expression, his eyes fell upon the green baize
that covered Napoleon's cage. He threw the
match into the grate, and puffed at the pipe as
he walked forward to the cage. When he
reached it he put out his hand, took hold of the
baize and began to pull it away. Then suddenly
he pushed it back over the cage.</p>

<p>"No," he said, as if to himself, "no."</p>

<p>He returned rather hastily to the fire and
threw himself once more into his armchair.</p>

<p>"You're wondering," he said to Father Murchison.
"So am I. I don't know at all what to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
make of it. I'll just tell you the facts and you
must tell me what you think of them. The night
before last, after a day of hard work&mdash;but no
harder than usual&mdash;I went to the front door to
get a breath of air. You know I often do that."</p>

<p>"Yes, I found you on the doorstep when I
first came here."</p>

<p>"Just so. I didn't put on hat or coat. I
just stood on the step as I was. My mind, I remember,
was still full of my work. It was rather
a dark night, not very dark. The hour was about
eleven, or a quarter past. I was staring at the
Park, and presently I found that my eyes were
directed towards somebody who was sitting, back
to me, on one of the benches. I saw the person&mdash;if
it was a person,&mdash;through the railings."</p>

<p>"If it was a person!" said the Father. "What
do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. I say that because it was too
dark for me to know. I merely saw some blackish
object on the bench, rising into view above
the level of the back of the seat. I couldn't say
it was man, woman or child. But something
there was, and I found that I was looking at it."</p>

<p>"I understand."</p>

<p>"Gradually, I also found that my thoughts
were becoming fixed upon this thing or person.
I began to wonder, first, what it was doing there;
next, what it was thinking; lastly, what it was like."</p>

<p>"Some poor creature without a home, I suppose,"
said the Father.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>"I said that to myself. Still, I was taken with
an extraordinary interest about this object, so
great an interest that I got my hat and crossed
the road to go into the Park. As you know,
there's an entrance almost opposite to my house.
Well, Murchison, I crossed the road, passed
through the gate in the railings, went up to the
seat, and found that there was&mdash;nothing on it."</p>

<p>"Were you looking at it as you walked?"</p>

<p>"Part of the time. But I removed my eyes
from it just as I passed through the gate, because
there was a row going on a little way off, and I
turned for an instant in that direction. When I
saw that the seat was vacant I was seized by a
most absurd sensation of disappointment, almost
of anger. I stopped and looked about me to see
if anything was moving away, but I could see
nothing. It was a cold night and misty, and
there were few people about. Feeling, as I say,
foolishly and unnaturally disappointed, I retraced
my steps to this house. When I got here I
discovered that during my short absence I had
left the hall door open&mdash;half open."</p>

<p>"Rather imprudent in London."</p>

<p>"Yes. I had no idea, of course, that I had
done so, till I got back. However, I was only
away three minutes or so."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It was not likely that anybody had gone in."</p>

<p>"I suppose not."</p>

<p>"Was it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why do you ask me that, Guildea?"</p>

<p>"Well, well!"</p>

<p>"Besides, if anybody had gone in on your return
you'd have caught him, surely."</p>

<p>Guildea coughed again. The Father, surprised,
could not fail to recognise that he was nervous
and that his nervousness was affecting him physically.</p>

<p>"I must have caught cold that night," he said,
as if he had read his friend's thought and hastened
to contradict it. Then he went on:</p>

<p>"I entered the hall, or passage, rather."</p>

<p>He paused again. His uneasiness was becoming
very apparent.</p>

<p>"And you did catch somebody?" said the
Father.</p>

<p>Guildea cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"That's just it," he said, "now we come to it.
I'm not imaginative, as you know."</p>

<p>"You certainly are not."</p>

<p>"No, but hardly had I stepped into the passage
before I felt certain that somebody had got
into the house during my absence. I felt convinced
of it, and not only that, I also felt convinced
that the intruder was the very person I
had dimly seen sitting upon the seat in the Park.
What d'you say to that?"</p>

<p>"I begin to think you are imaginative."</p>

<p>"H'm! It seemed to me that the person&mdash;the
occupant of the seat&mdash;and I, had simultaneously
formed the project of interviewing each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
other, had simultaneously set out to put that
project into execution. I became so certain of
this that I walked hastily upstairs into this room,
expecting to find the visitor awaiting me. But
there was no one. I then came down again and
went into the dining-room. No one. I was
actually astonished. Isn't that odd?"</p>

<p>"Very," said the Father, quite gravely.</p>

<p>The Professor's chill and gloomy manner, and
uncomfortable, constrained appearance kept away
the humour that might well have lurked round
the steps of such a discourse.</p>

<p>"I went upstairs again," he continued, "sat
down and thought the matter over. I resolved
to forget it, and took up a book. I might perhaps
have been able to read, but suddenly I
thought I noticed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly. Father Murchison observed
that he was staring towards the green
baize that covered the parrot's cage.</p>

<p>"But that's nothing," he said. "Enough that
I couldn't read. I resolved to explore the house.
You know how small it is, how easily one can go
all over it. I went all over it. I went into every
room without exception. To the servants, who
were having supper, I made some excuse. They
were surprised at my advent, no doubt."</p>

<p>"And Pitting?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he got up politely when I came in, stood
while I was there, but never said a word. I muttered
'don't disturb yourselves,' or something of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
the sort, and came out. Murchison, I found nobody
new in the house&mdash;yet I returned to this
room entirely convinced that somebody had entered
while I was in the Park."</p>

<p>"And gone out again before you came back?"</p>

<p>"No, had stayed, and was still in the house."</p>

<p>"But, my dear Guildea," began the Father,
now in great astonishment. "Surely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what you want to say&mdash;what I should
want to say in your place. Now, do wait. I am
also convinced that this visitor has not left the
house and is at this moment in it."</p>

<p>He spoke with evident sincerity, with extreme
gravity. Father Murchison looked him full in
the face, and met his quick, keen eyes.</p>

<p>"No," he said, as if in reply to an uttered
question: "I'm perfectly sane, I assure you. The
whole matter seems almost as incredible to me
as it must to you. But, as you know, I never
quarrel with facts, however strange. I merely
try to examine into them thoroughly. I have
already consulted a doctor and been pronounced
in perfect bodily health."</p>

<p>He paused, as if expecting the Father to say
something.</p>

<p>"Go on, Guildea," he said, "you haven't
finished."</p>

<p>"No. I felt that night positive that somebody
had entered the house, and remained in it, and
my conviction grew. I went to bed as usual, and,
contrary to my expectation, slept as well as I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
generally do. Yet directly I woke up yesterday
morning I knew that my household had been increased
by one."</p>

<p>"May I interrupt you for one moment? How
did you know it?"</p>

<p>"By my mental sensation. I can only say that
I was perfectly conscious of a new presence within
my house, close to me."</p>

<p>"How very strange," said the Father. "And
you feel absolutely certain that you are not over-worked?
Your brain does not feel tired? Your
head is quite clear?"</p>

<p>"Quite. I was never better. When I came
down to breakfast that morning I looked sharply
into Pitting's face. He was as coldly placid and
inexpressive as usual. It was evident to me that
his mind was in no way distressed. After breakfast
I sat down to work, all the time ceaselessly
conscious of the fact of this intruder upon my
privacy. Nevertheless, I laboured for several
hours, waiting for any development that might
occur to clear away the mysterious obscurity of
this event. I lunched. About half-past two I
was obliged to go out to attend a lecture. I
therefore, took my coat and hat, opened my door,
and stepped on to the pavement. I was instantly
aware that I was no longer intruded upon, and
this although I was now in the street, surrounded
by people. Consequently, I felt certain that the
thing in my house must be thinking of me, perhaps
even spying upon me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait a moment," interrupted the Father.
"What was your sensation? Was it one of fear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear no. I was entirely puzzled,&mdash;as I
am now&mdash;and keenly interested, but not in any
way alarmed. I delivered my lecture with my
usual ease and returned home in the evening. On
entering the house again I was perfectly conscious
that the intruder was still there. Last night I
dined alone and spent the hours after dinner in
reading a scientific work in which I was deeply
interested. While I read, however, I never for
one moment lost the knowledge that some mind&mdash;very
attentive to me&mdash;was within hail of mine.
I will say more than this&mdash;the sensation constantly
increased, and, by the time I got up to go
to bed, I had come to a very strange conclusion."</p>

<p>"What? What was it?"</p>

<p>"That whoever&mdash;or whatever&mdash;had entered my
house during my short absence in the Park was
more than interested in me."</p>

<p>"More than interested in you?"</p>

<p>"Was fond, or was becoming fond, of me."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed the Father. "Now I understand
why you asked me just now whether I
thought there was anything about you that might
draw a human being or an animal irresistibly to
you."</p>

<p>"Precisely. Since I came to this conclusion,
Murchison, I will confess that my feeling of
strong curiosity has become tinged with another
feeling."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of fear?"</p>

<p>"No, of dislike, of irritation. No&mdash;not fear,
not fear."</p>

<p>As Guildea repeated unnecessarily this asseveration
he looked again towards the parrot's cage.</p>

<p>"What is there to be afraid of in such a
matter?" he added. "I'm not a child to tremble
before bogies."</p>

<p>In saying the last words he raised his voice
sharply; then he walked quickly to the cage, and,
with an abrupt movement, pulled the baize covering
from it. Napoleon was disclosed, apparently
dozing upon his perch with his head held
slightly on one side. As the light reached him,
he moved, ruffled the feathers about his neck,
blinked his eyes, and began slowly to sidle to and
fro, thrusting his head forward and drawing it
back with an air of complacent, though rather
unmeaning, energy. Guildea stood by the cage,
looking at him closely, and indeed with an attention
that was so intense as to be remarkable,
almost unnatural.</p>

<p>"How absurd these birds are!" he said at
length, coming back to the fire.</p>

<p>"You have no more to tell me?" asked the
Father.</p>

<p>"No. I am still aware of the presence of
something in my house. I am still conscious of
its close attention to me. I am still irritated,
seriously annoyed&mdash;I confess it,&mdash;by that attention."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>"You say you are aware of the presence of
something at this moment?"</p>

<p>"At this moment&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"Do you mean in this room, with us, now?"</p>

<p>"I should say so&mdash;at any rate, quite near us."</p>

<p>Again he glanced quickly, almost suspiciously,
towards the cage of the parrot. The bird was
sitting still on its perch now. Its head was bent
down and cocked sideways, and it appeared to be
listening attentively to something.</p>

<p>"That bird will have the intonations of my
voice more correctly than ever by to-morrow
morning," said the Father, watching Guildea
closely with his mild blue eyes. "And it has always
imitated me very cleverly."</p>

<p>The Professor started slightly.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Yes, no doubt. Well, what
do you make of this affair?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all. It is absolutely inexplicable.
I can speak quite frankly to you, I feel sure."</p>

<p>"Of course. That's why I have told you the
whole thing."</p>

<p>"I think you must be over-worked, over-strained,
without knowing it."</p>

<p>"And that the doctor was mistaken when he
said I was all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Guildea knocked his pipe out against the
chimney piece.</p>

<p>"It may be so," he said, "I will not be so unreasonable
as to deny the possibility, although I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
feel as well as I ever did in my life. What do
you advise then?"</p>

<p>"A week of complete rest away from London,
in good air."</p>

<p>"The usual prescription. I'll take it. I'll go
to-morrow to Westgate and leave Napoleon to
keep house in my absence."</p>

<p>For some reason, which he could not explain
to himself, the pleasure which Father Murchison
felt in hearing the first part of his friend's final
remark was lessened, was almost destroyed, by
the last sentence.</p>

<p>He walked towards the City that night, deep
in thought, remembering and carefully considering
the first interview he had with Guildea in the
latter's house a year and a half before.</p>

<p>On the following morning Guildea left London.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Father Murchison</span> was so busy a man that
he had little time for brooding over the affairs of
others. During Guildea's week at the sea, however,
the Father thought about him a great deal,
with much wonder and some dismay. The dismay
was soon banished, for the mild-eyed priest was
quick to discern weakness in himself, quicker
still to drive it forth as a most undesirable inmate
of the soul. But the wonder remained. It was
destined to a crescendo. Guildea had left London<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
on a Thursday. On a Thursday he returned,
having previously sent a note to Father Murchison
to mention that he was leaving Westgate at
a certain time. When his train ran in to Victoria
Station, at five o'clock in the evening, he was
surprised to see the cloaked figure of his friend
standing upon the grey platform behind a line of
porters.</p>

<p>"What, Murchison!" he said. "You here!
Have you seceded from your order that you are
taking this holiday?"</p>

<p>They shook hands.</p>

<p>"No," said the Father. "It happened that I
had to be in this neighbourhood to-day, visiting
a sick person. So I thought I would meet
you."</p>

<p>"And see if I were still a sick person, eh?"</p>

<p>The Professor glanced at him kindly, but with
a dry little laugh.</p>

<p>"Are you?" replied the Father gently, looking
at him with interest. "No, I think not. You
appear very well."</p>

<p>The sea air had, in fact, put some brownish red
into Guildea's always thin cheeks. His keen eyes
were shining with life and energy, and he walked
forward in his loose grey suit and fluttering overcoat
with a vigour that was noticeable, carrying
easily in his left hand his well-filled Gladstone
bag.</p>

<p>The Father felt completely reassured.</p>

<p>"I never saw you look better," he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>"I never was better. Have you an hour to
spare?"</p>

<p>"Two."</p>

<p>"Good. I'll send my bag up by cab, and we'll
walk across the Park to my house and have a cup
of tea there. What d'you say?"</p>

<p>"I shall enjoy it."</p>

<p>They walked out of the station yard, past the
flower girls and newspaper sellers towards Grosvenor
Place.</p>

<p>"And you have had a pleasant time?" the
Father said.</p>

<p>"Pleasant enough, and lonely. I left my companion
behind me in the passage at Number 100,
you know."</p>

<p>"And you'll not find him there now, I feel
sure."</p>

<p>"H'm!" ejaculated Guildea. "What a precious
weakling you think me, Murchison."</p>

<p>As he spoke he strode forward more quickly,
as if moved to emphasise his sensation of bodily
vigour.</p>

<p>"A weakling&mdash;no. But anyone who uses his
brain as persistently as you do yours must require
an occasional holiday."</p>

<p>"And I required one very badly, eh?"</p>

<p>"You required one, I believe."</p>

<p>"Well, I've had it. And now we'll see."</p>

<p>The evening was closing in rapidly. They
crossed the road at Hyde Park Corner, and entered
the Park, in which were a number of people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
going home from work; men in corduroy trousers,
caked with dried mud, and carrying tin cans
slung over their shoulders, and flat panniers, in
which lay their tools. Some of the younger ones
talked loudly or whistled shrilly as they walked.</p>

<p>"Until the evening," murmured Father Murchison
to himself.</p>

<p>"What?" asked Guildea.</p>

<p>"I was only quoting the last words of the text,
which seems written upon life, especially upon
the life of pleasure: 'Man goeth forth to his
work, and to his labour.'"</p>

<p>"Ah, those fellows are not half bad fellows to
have in an audience. There were a lot of them
at the lecture I gave when I first met you, I remember.
One of them tried to heckle me. He
had a red beard. Chaps with red beards are always
hecklers. I laid him low on that occasion.
Well, Murchison, and now we're going to see."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Whether my companion has departed."</p>

<p>"Tell me&mdash;do you feel any expectation of&mdash;well&mdash;of
again thinking something is there?"</p>

<p>"How carefully you choose language. No, I
merely wonder."</p>

<p>"You have no apprehension?"</p>

<p>"Not a scrap. But I confess to feeling curious."</p>

<p>"Then the sea air hasn't taught you to recognise
that the whole thing came from overstrain."</p>

<p>"No," said Guildea, very drily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>He walked on in silence for a minute. Then
he added:</p>

<p>"You thought it would?"</p>

<p>"I certainly thought it might."</p>

<p>"Make me realise that I had a sickly, morbid,
rotten imagination&mdash;heh? Come now, Murchison,
why not say frankly that you packed me off
to Westgate to get rid of what you considered
an acute form of hysteria?"</p>

<p>The Father was quite unmoved by this attack.</p>

<p>"Come now, Guildea," he retorted, "what did
you expect me to think? I saw no indication of
hysteria in you. I never have. One would suppose
you the last man likely to have such a malady.
But which is more natural&mdash;for me to believe
in your hysteria or in the truth of such a
story as you told me?"</p>

<p>"You have me there. No, I mustn't complain.
Well, there's no hysteria about me now, at any
rate."</p>

<p>"And no stranger in your house, I hope."</p>

<p>Father Murchison spoke the last words with
earnest gravity, dropping the half-bantering tone&mdash;which
they had both assumed.</p>

<p>"You take the matter very seriously, I believe,"
said Guildea, also speaking more gravely.</p>

<p>"How else can I take it? You wouldn't have
me laugh at it when you tell it me seriously?"</p>

<p>"No. If we find my visitor still in the house,
I may even call upon you to exorcise it. But
first I must do one thing."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>"And that is?"</p>

<p>"Prove to you, as well as to myself, that it is
still there."</p>

<p>"That might be difficult," said the Father,
considerably surprised by Guildea's matter-of-fact
tone.</p>

<p>"I don't know. If it has remained in my
house I think I can find a means. And I shall
not be at all surprised if it is still there&mdash;despite
the Westgate air."</p>

<p>In saying the last words the Professor relapsed
into his former tone of dry chaff. The
Father could not quite make up his mind whether
Guildea was feeling unusually grave or unusually
gay. As the two men drew near to Hyde Park
Place their conversation died away and they
walked forward silently in the gathering darkness.</p>

<p>"Here we are!" said Guildea at last.</p>

<p>He thrust his key into the door, opened it and
let Father Murchison into the passage, following
him closely and banging the door.</p>

<p>"Here we are!" he repeated in a louder voice.</p>

<p>The electric light was turned on in anticipation
of his arrival. He stood still and looked round.</p>

<p>"We'll have some tea at once," he said. "Ah,
Pitting!"</p>

<p>The pale butler, who had heard the door bang,
moved gently forward from the top of the stairs
that led to the kitchen, greeted his master respectfully,
took his coat and Father Murchison's
cloak, and hung them on two pegs against the wall.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>"All's right, Pitting? All's as usual?" said
Guildea.</p>

<p>"Quite so, sir."</p>

<p>"Bring us up some tea to the library."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Pitting retreated. Guildea waited till he had
disappeared, then opened the dining-room door,
put his head into the room and kept it there for
a moment, standing perfectly still. Presently he
drew back into the passage, shut the door, and
said,</p>

<p>"Let's go upstairs."</p>

<p>Father Murchison looked at him enquiringly,
but made no remark. They ascended the stairs
and came into the library. Guildea glanced
rather sharply round. A fire was burning on the
hearth. The blue curtains were drawn. The
bright gleam of the strong electric light fell on
the long rows of books, on the writing table,&mdash;very
orderly in consequence of Guildea's holiday&mdash;and
on the uncovered cage of the parrot.
Guildea went up to the cage. Napoleon was sitting
humped up on his perch with his feathers
ruffled. His long toes, which looked as if they
were covered with crocodile skin, clung to the
bar. His round and blinking eyes were filmy,
like old eyes. Guildea stared at the bird very
hard, and then clucked with his tongue against his
teeth. Napoleon shook himself, lifted one foot,
extended his toes, sidled along the perch to the
bars nearest to the Professor and thrust his head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
against them. Guildea scratched it with his forefinger
two or three times, still gazing attentively
at the parrot; then he returned to the fire just as
Pitting entered with the tea-tray.</p>

<p>Father Murchison was already sitting in an armchair
on one side of the fire. Guildea took
another chair and began to pour out tea, as Pitting
left the room closing the door gently behind
him. The Father sipped his tea, found it hot
and set the cup down on a little table at his side.</p>

<p>"You're fond of that parrot, aren't you?" he
asked his friend.</p>

<p>"Not particularly. It's interesting to study
sometimes. The parrot mind and nature are
peculiar."</p>

<p>"How long have you had him?"</p>

<p>"About four years. I nearly got rid of him just
before I made your acquaintance. I'm very glad
now I kept him."</p>

<p>"Are you? Why is that?"</p>

<p>"I shall probably tell you in a day or two."</p>

<p>The Father took his cup again. He did not
press Guildea for an immediate explanation, but
when they had both finished their tea he said:</p>

<p>"Well, has the sea-air had the desired effect?"</p>

<p>"No," said Guildea.</p>

<p>The Father brushed some crumbs from the
front of his cassock and sat up higher in his chair.</p>

<p>"Your visitor is still here?" he asked, and his
blue eyes became almost ungentle and piercing
as he gazed at his friend.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," answered Guildea, calmly.</p>

<p>"How do you know it, when did you know it&mdash;when
you looked into the dining-room just
now?"</p>

<p>"No. Not until I came into this room. It
welcomed me here."</p>

<p>"Welcomed you! In what way?"</p>

<p>"Simply by being here, by making me feel
that it is here, as I might feel that a man was if I
came into the room when it was dark."</p>

<p>He spoke quietly, with perfect composure in
his usual dry manner.</p>

<p>"Very well," the Father said, "I shall not try
to contend against your sensation, or to explain
it away. Naturally, I am in amazement."</p>

<p>"So am I. Never has anything in my life surprised
me so much. Murchison, of course I cannot
expect you to believe more than that I honestly
suppose&mdash;imagine, if you like&mdash;that there is
some intruder here, of what kind I am totally unaware.
I cannot expect you to believe that there
really is anything. If you were in my place, I in
yours, I should certainly consider you the victim
of some nervous delusion. I could not do otherwise.
But&mdash;wait. Don't condemn me as a hysteria
patient, or as a madman, for two or three
days. I feel convinced that&mdash;unless I am indeed
unwell, a mental invalid, which I don't think is
possible&mdash;I shall be able very shortly to give you
some proof that there is a newcomer in my
house."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't tell me what kind of proof?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. Things must go a little farther first.
But, perhaps even to-morrow I may be able to
explain myself more fully. In the meanwhile,
I'll say this, that if, eventually, I can't bring any
kind of proof that I'm not dreaming I'll let you
take me to any doctor you like, and I'll resolutely
try to adopt your present view&mdash;that I'm suffering
from an absurd delusion. That is your view
of course?"</p>

<p>Father Murchison was silent for a moment.
Then he said, rather doubtfully:</p>

<p>"It ought to be."</p>

<p>"But isn't it?" asked Guildea, surprised.</p>

<p>"Well, you know, your manner is enormously
convincing. Still, of course, I doubt. How can
I do otherwise? The whole thing must be
fancy."</p>

<p>The Father spoke as if he were trying to recoil
from a mental position he was being forced to
take up.</p>

<p>"It must be fancy," he repeated.</p>

<p>"I'll convince you by more than my manner,
or I'll not try to convince you at all," said Guildea.</p>

<p>When they parted that evening, he said,</p>

<p>"I'll write to you in a day or two probably. I
think the proof I am going to give you has been
accumulating during my absence. But I shall
soon know."</p>

<p>Father Murchison was extremely puzzled as he
sat on the top of the omnibus going homeward.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> two days' time he received a note from
Guildea asking him to call, if possible, the same
evening. This he was unable to do as he had an
engagement to fulfil at some East End gathering.
The following day was Sunday. He wrote saying
he would come on the Monday, and got a
wire shortly afterwards: "Yes, Monday come to
dinner seven-thirty Guildea." At half-past seven
he stood on the doorstep of Number 100.</p>

<p>Pitting let him in.</p>

<p>"Is the Professor quite well, Pitting?" the
Father enquired as he took off his cloak.</p>

<p>"I believe so, sir. He has not made any complaint,"
the butler formally replied. "Will you
come upstairs, sir?"</p>

<p>Guildea met them at the door of the library.
He was very pale and sombre, and shook hands
carelessly with his friend.</p>

<p>"Give us dinner," he said to Pitting.</p>

<p>As the butler retired, Guildea shut the door
rather cautiously. Father Murchison had never
before seen him look so disturbed.</p>

<p>"You're worried, Guildea," the Father said.
"Seriously worried."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. This business is beginning to tell
on me a good deal."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your belief in the presence of something here
continues then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, yes. There's no sort of doubt about
the matter. The night I went across the road
into the Park something got into the house,
though what the devil it is I can't yet find out.
But now, before we go down to dinner, I'll just
tell you something about that proof I promised
you. You remember?"</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>"Can't you imagine what it might be."</p>

<p>Father Murchison moved his head to express a
negative reply.</p>

<p>"Look about the room," said Guildea. "What
do you see?"</p>

<p>The Father glanced round the room, slowly
and carefully.</p>

<p>"Nothing unusual. You do not mean to tell
me there is any appearance of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, there's no conventional, white-robed,
cloud-like figure. Bless my soul, no! I
haven't fallen so low as that."</p>

<p>He spoke with considerable irritation.</p>

<p>"Look again."</p>

<p>Father Murchison looked at him, turned in the
direction of his fixed eyes and saw the grey
parrot clambering in its cage, slowly and persistently.</p>

<p>"What?" he said, quickly. "Will the proof
come from there?"</p>

<p>The Professor nodded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe so," he said. "Now let's go down
to dinner. I want some food badly."</p>

<p>They descended to the dining-room. While
they ate and Pitting waited upon them, the Professor
talked about birds, their habits, their
curiosities, their fears and their powers of imitation.
He had evidently studied this subject with
the thoroughness that was characteristic of him in
all that he did.</p>

<p>"Parrots," he said presently, "are extraordinarily
observant. It is a pity that their means
of reproducing what they see are so limited. If
it were not so, I have little doubt that their echo
of gesture would be as remarkable as their echo
of voice often is."</p>

<p>"But hands are missing."</p>

<p>"Yes. They do many things with their heads,
however. I once knew an old woman near Goring
on the Thames. She was afflicted with the
palsy. She held her head perpetually sideways
and it trembled, moving from right to left. Her
sailor son brought her home a parrot from one
of his voyages. It used to reproduce the old
woman's palsied movement of the head exactly.
Those grey parrots are always on the watch."</p>

<p>Guildea said the last sentence slowly and deliberately,
glancing sharply over his wine at
Father Murchison, and, when he had spoken it,
a sudden light of comprehension dawned in the
Priest's mind. He opened his lips to make a
swift remark. Guildea turned his bright eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
towards Pitting, who at the moment was tenderly
bearing a cheese meringue from the lift that connected
the dining-room with the lower regions.
The Father closed his lips again. But presently,
when the butler had placed some apples on the
table, had meticulously arranged the decanters,
brushed away the crumbs and evaporated, he
said, quickly,</p>

<p>"I begin to understand. You think Napoleon
is aware of the intruder?"</p>

<p>"I know it. He has been watching my visitant
ever since the night of that visitant's arrival."</p>

<p>Another flash of light came to the Priest.</p>

<p>"That was why you covered him with green
baize one evening?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. An act of cowardice. His behaviour
was beginning to grate upon my nerves."</p>

<p>Guildea pursed up his thin lips and drew his
brows down, giving to his face a look of sudden
pain.</p>

<p>"But now I intend to follow his investigations,"
he added, straightening his features.
"The week I wasted at Westgate was not wasted
by him in London, I can assure you. Have an
apple."</p>

<p>"No, thank you; no, thank you."</p>

<p>The Father repeated the words without knowing
that he did so. Guildea pushed away his glass.</p>

<p>"Let us come upstairs, then."</p>

<p>"No, thank you," reiterated the Father.</p>

<p>"Eh?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>"What am I saying?" exclaimed the Father,
getting up. "I was thinking over this extraordinary
affair."</p>

<p>"Ah, you're beginning to forget the hysteria
theory?"</p>

<p>They walked out into the passage.</p>

<p>"Well, you are so very practical about the
whole matter."</p>

<p>"Why not? Here's something very strange
and abnormal come into my life. What should I
do but investigate it closely and calmly?"</p>

<p>"What, indeed?"</p>

<p>The Father began to feel rather bewildered,
under a sort of compulsion which seemed laid
upon him to give earnest attention to a matter
that ought to strike him&mdash;so he felt&mdash;as entirely
absurd. When they came into the library his
eyes immediately turned, with profound curiosity,
towards the parrot's cage. A slight smile curled
the Professor's lips. He recognised the effect he
was producing upon his friend. The Father saw
the smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not won over yet," he said in answer
to it.</p>

<p>"I know. Perhaps you may be before the
evening is over. Here comes the coffee. After
we have drunk it we'll proceed to our experiment.
Leave the coffee, Pitting, and don't disturb us
again."</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"I won't have it black to-night," said the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Father, "plenty of milk, please. I don't want my
nerves played upon."</p>

<p>"Suppose we don't take coffee at all?" said
Guildea. "If we do you may trot out the theory
that we are not in a perfectly normal condition.
I know you, Murchison, devout Priest and devout
sceptic."</p>

<p>The Father laughed and pushed away his cup.</p>

<p>"Very well, then. No coffee."</p>

<p>"One cigarette, and then to business."</p>

<p>The grey blue smoke curled up.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?" said the Father.</p>

<p>He was sitting bolt upright as if ready for
action. Indeed there was no suggestion of repose
in the attitudes of either of the men.</p>

<p>"Hide ourselves, and watch Napoleon. By
the way&mdash;that reminds me."</p>

<p>He got up, went to a corner of the room,
picked up a piece of green baize and threw it
over the cage.</p>

<p>"I'll pull that off when we are hidden."</p>

<p>"And tell me first if you have had any manifestation
of this supposed presence during the
last few days?"</p>

<p>"Merely an increasingly intense sensation of
something here, perpetually watching me, perpetually
attending to all my doings."</p>

<p>"Do you feel that it follows you about?"</p>

<p>"Not always. It was in this room when you
arrived. It is here now&mdash;I feel. But, in going
down to dinner, we seemed to get away from it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
The conclusion is that it remained here. Don't
let us talk about it just now."</p>

<p>They spoke of other things till their cigarettes
were finished. Then, as they threw away the
smouldering ends, Guildea said,</p>

<p>"Now, Murchison, for the sake of this experiment,
I suggest that we should conceal ourselves
behind the curtains on either side of the cage, so
that the bird's attention may not be drawn
towards us and so distracted from that which we
want to know more about. I will pull away the
green baize when we are hidden. Keep perfectly
still, watch the bird's proceedings, and tell me
afterwards how you feel about them, how you
explain them. Tread softly."</p>

<p>The Father obeyed, and they stole towards
the curtains that fell before the two windows.
The Father concealed himself behind those on
the left of the cage, the Professor behind those
on the right. The latter, as soon as they were
hidden, stretched out his arm, drew the baize
down from the cage, and let it fall on the floor.</p>

<p>The parrot, which had evidently fallen asleep
in the warm darkness, moved on its perch as the
light shone upon it, ruffled the feathers round its
throat, and lifted first one foot and then the
other. It turned its head round on its supple,
and apparently elastic, neck, and, diving its beak
into the down upon its back, made some searching
investigations with, as it seemed, a satisfactory
result, for it soon lifted its head again,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
glanced around its cage, and began to address itself
to a nut which had been fixed between the
bars for its refreshment. With its curved beak
it felt and tapped the nut, at first gently, then
with severity. Finally it plucked the nut from
the bars, seized it with its rough, grey toes, and,
holding it down firmly on the perch, cracked it
and pecked out its contents, scattering some on
the floor of the cage and letting the fractured
shell fall into the china bath that was fixed
against the bars. This accomplished, the bird
paused meditatively, extended one leg backwards,
and went through an elaborate process of
wing-stretching that made it look as if it were
lopsided and deformed. With its head reversed,
it again applied itself to a subtle and exhaustive
search among the feathers of its wing. This
time its investigation seemed interminable, and
Father Murchison had time to realise the absurdity
of the whole position, and to wonder why he
had lent himself to it. Yet he did not find his
sense of humour laughing at it. On the contrary,
he was smitten by a sudden gust of horror.
When he was talking to his friend and watching
him, the Professor's manner, generally so calm,
even so prosaic, vouched for the truth of his
story and the well-adjusted balance of his mind.
But when he was hidden this was not so. And
Father Murchison, standing behind his curtain,
with his eyes upon the unconcerned Napoleon,
began to whisper to himself the word&mdash;madness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
with a quickening sensation of pity and of
dread.</p>

<p>The parrot sharply contracted one wing,
ruffled the feathers around its throat again, then
extended its other leg backwards, and proceeded
to the cleaning of its other wing. In the still
room the dry sound of the feathers being spread
was distinctly audible. Father Murchison saw
the blue curtains behind which Guildea stood
tremble slightly, as if a breath of wind had
come through the window they shrouded. The
clock in the far room chimed, and a coal dropped
into the grate, making a noise like dead leaves
stirring abruptly on hard ground. And again a
gust of pity and of dread swept over the Father.
It seemed to him that he had behaved very
foolishly, if not wrongly, in encouraging what
must surely be the strange dementia of his friend.
He ought to have declined to lend himself to a
proceeding that, ludicrous, even childish in itself,
might well be dangerous in the encouragement it
gave to a diseased expectation. Napoleon's protruding
leg, extended wing and twisted neck, his
busy and unconscious devotion to the arrangement
of his person, his evident sensation of complete
loneliness, most comfortable solitude, brought
home with vehemence to the Father the undignified
buffoonery of his conduct; the more piteous
buffoonery of his friend. He seized the curtains
with his hands and was about to thrust them
aside and issue forth when an abrupt movement
of the parrot stopped him. The bird, as if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
sharply attracted by something, paused in its
pecking, and, with its head still bent backward and
twisted sideways on its neck, seemed to listen intently.
Its round eye looked glistening and
strained like the eye of a disturbed pigeon. Contracting
its wing, it lifted its head and sat for a moment
erect on its perch, shifting its feet mechanically
up and down, as if a dawning excitement
produced in it an uncontrollable desire of movement.
Then it thrust its head forward in the direction
of the further room and remained perfectly
still. Its attitude so strongly suggested
the concentration of its attention on something
immediately before it that Father Murchison instinctively
stared about the room, half expecting
to see Pitting advance softly, having entered
through the hidden door. He did not come, and
there was no sound in the chamber. Nevertheless,
the parrot was obviously getting excited
and increasingly attentive. It bent its head
lower and lower, stretching out its neck until,
almost falling from the perch, it half extended
its wings, raising them slightly from its back, as
if about to take flight, and fluttering them rapidly
up and down. It continued this fluttering
movement for what seemed to the Father an immense
time. At length, raising its wings as far
as possible, it dropped them slowly and deliberately
down to its back, caught hold of the edge
of its bath with its beak, hoisted itself on to the
floor of the cage, waddled to the bars, thrust its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
head against them, and stood quite still in the
exact attitude it always assumed when its head
was being scratched by the Professor. So complete
was the suggestion of this delight conveyed
by the bird that Father Murchison felt as if he
saw a white finger gently pushed among the soft
feathers of its head, and he was seized by a most
strong conviction that something, unseen by him
but seen and welcomed by Napoleon, stood immediately
before the cage.</p>

<p>The parrot presently withdrew its head, as if the
coaxing finger had been lifted from it, and its
pronounced air of acute physical enjoyment faded
into one of marked attention and alert curiosity.
Pulling itself up by the bars it climbed again upon
its perch, sidled to the left side of the cage, and
began apparently to watch something with profound
interest. It bowed its head oddly, paused
for a moment, then bowed its head again. Father
Murchison found himself conceiving&mdash;from this
elaborate movement of the head&mdash;a distinct idea
of a personality. The bird's proceedings suggested
extreme sentimentality combined with
that sort of weak determination which is often the
most persistent. Such weak determination is a
very common attribute of persons who are partially
idiotic. Father Murchison was moved to
think of these poor creatures who will often, so
strangely and unreasonably, attach themselves
with persistence to those who love them least.
Like many priests, he had had some experience of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
them, for the amorous idiot is peculiarly sensitive
to the attraction of preachers. This bowing movement
of the parrot recalled to his memory a terrible,
pale woman who for a time haunted all
churches in which he ministered, who was perpetually
endeavouring to catch his eye, and who
always bent her head with an obsequious and cunningly
conscious smile when she did so. The parrot
went on bowing, making a short pause between
each genuflection, as if it waited for a signal to be
given that called into play its imitative faculty.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, it's imitating an idiot," Father Murchison
caught himself saying as he watched.</p>

<p>And he looked again about the room, but saw
nothing; except the furniture, the dancing fire,
and the serried ranks of the books. Presently
the parrot ceased from bowing, and assumed the
concentrated and stretched attitude of one listening
very keenly. He opened his beak, showing
his black tongue, shut it, then opened it again.
The Father thought he was going to speak, but
he remained silent, although it was obvious that
he was trying to bring out something. He bowed
again two or three times, paused, and then, again
opening his beak, made some remark. The
Father could not distinguish any words, but the
voice was sickly and disagreeable, a cooing and,
at the same time, querulous voice, like a woman's,
he thought. And he put his ear nearer to the
curtain, listening with almost feverish attention.
The bowing was resumed, but this time Napoleon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
added to it a sidling movement, affectionate and
affected, like the movement of a silly and eager
thing, nestling up to someone, or giving someone
a gentle and furtive nudge. Again the Father
thought of that terrible, pale woman who had
haunted churches. Several times he had come
upon her waiting for him after evening services.
Once she had hung her head smiling, had lolled
out her tongue and pushed against him sideways
in the dark. He remembered how his flesh had
shrunk from the poor thing, the sick loathing of
her that he could not banish by remembering
that her mind was all astray. The parrot paused,
listened, opened his beak, and again said something
in the same dove-like, amorous voice, full
of sickly suggestion and yet hard, even dangerous,
in its intonation. A loathsome voice, the
Father thought it. But this time, although he
heard the voice more distinctly than before, he
could not make up his mind whether it was like
a woman's voice or a man's&mdash;or perhaps a child's.
It seemed to be a human voice, and yet oddly
sexless. In order to resolve his doubt he withdrew
into the darkness of the curtains, ceased to
watch Napoleon and simply listened with keen
attention, striving to forget that he was listening
to a bird, and to imagine that he was overhearing
a human being in conversation. After two or
three minutes' silence the voice spoke again, and
at some length, apparently repeating several
times an affectionate series of ejaculations with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
cooing emphasis that was unutterably mawkish
and offensive. The sickliness of the voice, its falling
intonations and its strange indelicacy, combined
with a die-away softness and meretricious
refinement, made the Father's flesh creep. Yet
he could not distinguish any words, nor could he
decide on the voice's sex or age. One thing
alone he was certain of as he stood still in the
darkness,&mdash;that such a sound could only proceed
from something peculiarly loathsome, could only
express a personality unendurably abominable to
him, if not to everybody. The voice presently
failed, in a sort of husky gasp, and there was
a prolonged silence. It was broken by the Professor,
who suddenly pulled away the curtains
that hid the Father and said to him:</p>

<p>"Come out now, and look."</p>

<p>The Father came into the light, blinking,
glanced towards the cage, and saw Napoleon
poised motionless on one foot with his head
under his wing. He appeared to be asleep.
The Professor was pale, and his mobile lips were
drawn into an expression of supreme disgust.</p>

<p>"Faugh!" he said.</p>

<p>He walked to the windows of the further room,
pulled aside the curtains and pushed the glass
up, letting in the air. The bare trees were visible
in the grey gloom outside. Guildea leaned out
for a minute drawing the night air into his lungs.
Presently he turned round to the Father, and
exclaimed abruptly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pestilent! Isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;most pestilent."</p>

<p>"Ever hear anything like it?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly."</p>

<p>"Nor I. It gives me nausea, Murchison, absolute
physical nausea."</p>

<p>He closed the window and walked uneasily
about the room.</p>

<p>"What d'you make of it?" he asked, over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"How d'you mean exactly?"</p>

<p>"Is it man's, woman's, or child's voice?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell, I can't make up my mind."</p>

<p>"Nor I."</p>

<p>"Have you heard it often?"</p>

<p>"Yes, since I returned from Westgate. There
are never any words that I can distinguish. What
a voice!"</p>

<p>He spat into the fire.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he said, throwing himself down
in a chair. "It turns my stomach&mdash;literally."</p>

<p>"And mine," said the Father, truly.</p>

<p>"The worst of it is," continued Guildea, with a
high, nervous accent, "that there's no brain with
it, none at all&mdash;only the cunning of idiotcy."</p>

<p>The Father started at this exact expression of
his own conviction by another.</p>

<p>"Why d'you start like that?" asked Guildea,
with a quick suspicion which showed the unnatural
condition of his nerves.</p>

<p>"Well, the very same idea had occurred to me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"That I was listening to the voice of something
idiotic."</p>

<p>"Ah! That's the devil of it, you know, to a man
like me. I could fight against brain&mdash;but this!"</p>

<p>He sprang up again, poked the fire violently,
then stood on the hearthrug with his back to it,
and his hands thrust into the high pockets of his
trousers.</p>

<p>"That's the voice of the thing that's got into
my house," he said. "Pleasant, isn't it?"</p>

<p>And now there was really horror in his eyes, and
in his voice.</p>

<p>"I must get it out," he exclaimed. "I must
get it out. But how?"</p>

<p>He tugged at his short black beard with a quivering
hand.</p>

<p>"How?" he continued. "For what is it?
Where is it?"</p>

<p>"You feel it's here&mdash;now?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly. But I couldn't tell you in what
part of the room."</p>

<p>He stared about, glancing rapidly at everything.</p>

<p>"Then you consider yourself haunted?" said
Father Murchison.</p>

<p>He, too, was much moved and disturbed,
although he was not conscious of the presence of
anything near them in the room.</p>

<p>"I have never believed in any nonsense of that
kind, as you know," Guildea answered. "I simply
state a fact which I cannot understand, and which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
is beginning to be very painful to me. There is
something here. But whereas most so-called
hauntings have been described to me as inimical,
what I am conscious of is that I am admired,
loved, desired. This is distinctly horrible to me,
Murchison, distinctly horrible."</p>

<p>Father Murchison suddenly remembered the
first evening he had spent with Guildea, and the
latter's expression almost of disgust, at the idea of
receiving warm affection from anyone. In the
light of that long ago conversation the present
event seemed supremely strange, and almost like
a punishment for an offence committed by the
Professor against humanity. But, looking up at
his friend's twitching face, the Father resolved not
to be caught in the net of his hideous belief.</p>

<p>"There can be nothing here," he said. "It's
impossible."</p>

<p>"What does that bird imitate, then?"</p>

<p>"The voice of someone who has been here."</p>

<p>"Within the last week then. For it never spoke
like that before, and mind, I noticed that it was
watching and striving to imitate something before
I went away, since the night that I went into the
Park, only since then."</p>

<p>"Somebody with a voice like that must have
been here while you were away," Father Murchison
repeated, with a gentle obstinacy.</p>

<p>"I'll soon find out."</p>

<p>Guildea pressed the bell. Pitting stole in
almost immediately.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pitting," said the Professor, speaking in a high,
sharp voice, "did anyone come into this room
during my absence at the sea?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, sir, except the maids&mdash;and me,
sir."</p>

<p>"Not a soul? You are certain?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly certain, sir."</p>

<p>The cold voice of the butler sounded surprised,
almost resentful. The Professor flung out his
hand towards the cage.</p>

<p>"Has the bird been here the whole time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"He was not moved, taken elsewhere, even for
a moment?"</p>

<p>Pitting's pale face began to look almost expressive,
and his lips were pursed.</p>

<p>"Certainly not, sir."</p>

<p>"Thank you. That will do."</p>

<p>The butler retired, moving with a sort of ostentatious
rectitude. When he had reached the door,
and was just going out, his master called,</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Pitting."</p>

<p>The butler paused. Guildea bit his lips, tugged
at his beard uneasily two or three times, and then
said,</p>

<p>"Have you noticed&mdash;er&mdash;the parrot talking
lately in a&mdash;a very peculiar, very disagreeable
voice?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;a soft voice like, sir."</p>

<p>"Ha! Since when?"</p>

<p>"Since you went away, sir. He's always at it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>"Exactly. Well, and what did you think of
it?"</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir?"</p>

<p>"What do you think about his talking in this
voice?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that it's only his play, sir."</p>

<p>"I see. That's all, Pitting."</p>

<p>The butler disappeared and closed the door
noiselessly behind him.</p>

<p>Guildea turned his eyes on his friend.</p>

<p>"There, you see!" he ejaculated.</p>

<p>"It's certainly very odd," said the Father.
"Very odd indeed. You are certain you have no
maid who talks at all like that?"</p>

<p>"My dear Murchison! Would you keep a servant
with such a voice about you for two days?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"My housemaid has been with me for five years,
my cook for seven. You've heard Pitting speak.
The three of them make up my entire household.
A parrot never speaks in a voice it has not heard.
Where has it heard that voice?"</p>

<p>"But we hear nothing?"</p>

<p>"No. Nor do we see anything. But it does.
It feels something too. Didn't you observe it
presenting its head to be scratched?"</p>

<p>"Certainly it seemed to be doing so."</p>

<p>"It was doing so."</p>

<p>Father Murchison said nothing. He was full
of increasing discomfort that almost amounted to
apprehension.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you convinced?" said Guildea, rather
irritably.</p>

<p>"No. The whole matter is very strange. But
till I hear, see, or feel&mdash;as you do&mdash;the presence
of something, I cannot believe."</p>

<p>"You mean that you will not?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. Well, it is time I went."</p>

<p>Guildea did not try to detain him, but said, as
he let him out,</p>

<p>"Do me a favour, come again to-morrow night."</p>

<p>The Father had an engagement. He hesitated,
looked into the Professor's face and said,</p>

<p>"I will. At nine I'll be with you. Good-night."</p>

<p>When he was on the pavement he felt relieved.
He turned round, saw Guildea stepping into his
passage, and shivered.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Father Murchison</span> walked all the way home
to Bird Street that night. He required exercise
after the strange and disagreeable evening he had
spent, an evening upon which he looked back already
as a man looks back upon a nightmare. In
his ears, as he walked, sounded the gentle and intolerable
voice. Even the memory of it caused
him physical discomfort. He tried to put it from
him, and to consider the whole matter calmly.
The Professor had offered his proof that there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
some strange presence in his house. Could any
reasonable man accept such proof? Father Murchison
told himself that no reasonable man could
accept it. The parrot's proceedings were, no
doubt, extraordinary. The bird had succeeded in
producing an extraordinary illusion of an invisible
presence in the room. But that there really was
such a presence the Father insisted on denying to
himself. The devoutly religious, those who believe
implicitly in the miracles recorded in the
Bible, and who regulate their lives by the messages
they suppose themselves to receive directly
from the Great Ruler of a hidden World, are seldom
inclined to accept any notion of supernatural
intrusion into the affairs of daily life. They put
it from them with anxious determination. They
regard it fixedly as hocus-pocus, childish if not
wicked.</p>

<p>Father Murchison inclined to the normal view
of the devoted churchman. He was determined
to incline to it. He could not&mdash;so he now told
himself&mdash;accept the idea that his friend was being
supernaturally punished for his lack of humanity,
his deficiency in affection, by being obliged to endure
the love of some horrible thing, which could
not be seen, heard, or handled. Nevertheless,
retribution did certainly seem to wait upon Guildea's
condition. That which he had unnaturally
dreaded and shrunk from in his thought he seemed
to be now forced unnaturally to suffer. The
Father prayed for his friend that night before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
little, humble altar in the barely-furnished, cell-like
chamber where he slept.</p>

<p>On the following evening, when he called in
Hyde Park Place, the door was opened by the
housemaid, and Father Murchison mounted the
stairs, wondering what had become of Pitting.
He was met at the library door by Guildea and
was painfully struck by the alteration in his appearance.
His face was ashen in hue, and there
were lines beneath his eyes. The eyes themselves
looked excited and horribly forlorn. His hair
and dress were disordered and his lips twitched
continually, as if he were shaken by some acute
nervous apprehension.</p>

<p>"What has become of Pitting?" asked the
Father, grasping Guildea's hot and feverish hand.</p>

<p>"He has left my service."</p>

<p>"Left your service!" exclaimed the Father in
utter amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes, this afternoon."</p>

<p>"May one ask why?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to tell you. It's all part and parcel
of this&mdash;this most odious business. You remember
once discussing the relations men ought to have
with their servants?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried the Father, with a flash of inspiration.
"The crisis has occurred?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the Professor, with a bitter
smile. "The crisis has occurred. I called upon
Pitting to be a man and a brother. He responded
by declining the invitation. I upbraided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
him. He gave me warning. I paid him his wages
and told him he could go at once. And he has
gone. What are you looking at me like that
for?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know," said Father Murchison, hastily
dropping his eyes, and looking away. "Why,"
he added. "Napoleon is gone too."</p>

<p>"I sold him to-day to one of those shops in
Shaftesbury Avenue."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"He sickened me with his abominable imitation
of&mdash;his intercourse with&mdash;well, you know what
he was at last night. Besides, I have no further
need of his proof to tell me I am not dreaming.
And, being convinced as I now am, that all I have
thought to have happened has actually happened,
I care very little about convincing others. Forgive
me for saying so, Murchison, but I am now
certain that my anxiety to make you believe in
the presence of something here really arose from
some faint doubt on that subject&mdash;within myself.
All doubt has now vanished."</p>

<p>"Tell me why."</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>Both men were standing by the fire. They
continued to stand while Guildea went on,</p>

<p>"Last night I felt it."</p>

<p>"What?" cried the Father.</p>

<p>"I say that last night, as I was going upstairs
to bed, I felt something accompanying me and
nestling up against me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>"How horrible!" exclaimed the Father, involuntarily.</p>

<p>Guildea smiled drearily.</p>

<p>"I will not deny the horror of it. I cannot,
since I was compelled to call on Pitting for assistance."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;tell me&mdash;what was it, at least what did
it seem to be?"</p>

<p>"It seemed to be a human being. It seemed,
I say; and what I mean exactly is that the effect
upon me was rather that of human contact than
of anything else. But I could see nothing, hear
nothing. Only, three times, I felt this gentle, but
determined, push against me, as if to coax me and
to attract my attention. The first time it happened
I was on the landing outside this room, with my
foot on the first stair. I will confess to you, Murchison,
that I bounded upstairs like one pursued.
That is the shameful truth. Just as I was about
to enter my bedroom, however, I felt the thing
entering with me, and, as I have said, squeezing,
with loathsome, sickening tenderness, against my
side. Then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, turned towards the fire and leaned
his head on his arm. The Father was greatly
moved by the strange helplessness and despair of
the attitude. He laid his hand affectionately on
Guildea's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Then?"</p>

<p>Guildea lifted his head. He looked painfully
abashed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, Murchison, I am ashamed to say I broke
down, suddenly, unaccountably, in a way I should
have thought wholly impossible to me. I struck
out with my hands to thrust the thing away. It
pressed more closely to me. The pressure, the
contact became unbearable to me. I shouted out
for Pitting. I&mdash;I believe I must have cried&mdash;'Help.'"</p>

<p>"He came, of course?"</p>

<p>"Yes, with his usual soft, unemotional quiet.
His calm&mdash;its opposition to my excitement of
disgust and horror&mdash;must, I suppose, have irritated
me. I was not myself, no, no!"</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>"But I need hardly tell you that," he added,
with most piteous irony.</p>

<p>"And what did you say to Pitting?"</p>

<p>"I said that he should have been quicker. He
begged my pardon. His cold voice really maddened
me, and I burst out into some foolish, contemptible
diatribe, called him a machine, taunted
him, then&mdash;as I felt that loathsome thing nestling
once more to me,&mdash;begged him to assist me, to
stay with me, not to leave me alone&mdash;I meant in
the company of my tormentor. Whether he was
frightened, or whether he was angry at my unjust
and violent manner and speech a moment before,
I don't know. In any case he answered that he
was engaged as a butler, and not to sit up all night
with people. I suspect he thought I had taken
too much to drink. No doubt that was it. I believe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
I swore at him as a coward&mdash;I! This morning
he said he wished to leave my service. I gave
him a month's wages, a good character as a butler,
and sent him off at once."</p>

<p>"But the night? How did you pass it?"</p>

<p>"I sat up all night."</p>

<p>"Where? In your bedroom?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;with the door open&mdash;to let it go."</p>

<p>"You felt that it stayed?"</p>

<p>"It never left me for a moment, but it did not
touch me again. When it was light I took a bath,
lay down for a little while, but did not close my
eyes. After breakfast I had the explanation with
Pitting and paid him. Then I came up here. My
nerves were in a very shattered condition. Well,
I sat down, tried to write, to think. But the silence
was broken in the most abominable manner."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"By the murmur of that appalling voice, that
voice of a love-sick idiot, sickly but determined.
Ugh!"</p>

<p>He shuddered in every limb. Then he pulled
himself together, assumed, with a self-conscious
effort, his most determined, most aggressive, manner,
and added:</p>

<p>"I couldn't stand that. I had come to the end
of my tether; so I sprang up, ordered a cab to be
called, seized the cage and drove with it to a bird
shop in Shaftesbury Avenue. There I sold the
parrot for a trifle. I think, Murchison, that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
must have been nearly mad then, for, as I came
out of the wretched shop, and stood for an instant
on the pavement among the cages of rabbits,
guinea-pigs, and puppy dogs, I laughed
aloud. I felt as if a load was lifted from my
shoulders, as if in selling that voice I had sold
the cursed thing that torments me. But when I
got back to the house it was here. It's here now.
I suppose it will always be here."</p>

<p>He shuffled his feet on the rug in front of the
fire.</p>

<p>"What on earth am I to do?" he said. "I'm
ashamed of myself, Murchison, but&mdash;but I suppose
there are things in the world that certain
men simply can't endure. Well, I can't endure
this, and there's an end of the matter."</p>

<p>He ceased. The Father was silent. In presence
of this extraordinary distress he did not
know what to say. He recognised the uselessness
of attempting to comfort Guildea, and he sat
with his eyes turned, almost moodily, to the
ground. And while he sat there he tried to give
himself to the influences within the room, to feel
all that was within it. He even, half-unconsciously,
tried to force his imagination to play tricks
with him. But he remained totally unaware of
any third person with them. At length he said,</p>

<p>"Guildea, I cannot pretend to doubt the reality
of your misery here. You must go away, and at
once. When is your Paris lecture?"</p>

<p>"Next week. In nine days from now."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go to Paris to-morrow then, you say you have
never had any consciousness that this&mdash;this thing
pursued you beyond your own front door!"</p>

<p>"Never&mdash;hitherto."</p>

<p>"Go to-morrow morning. Stay away till after
your lecture. And then let us see if the affair is
at an end. Hope, my dear friend, hope."</p>

<p>He had stood up. Now he clasped the Professor's
hand.</p>

<p>"See all your friends in Paris. Seek distractions.
I would ask you also to seek&mdash;other help."</p>

<p>He said the last words with a gentle, earnest
gravity and simplicity that touched Guildea, who
returned his handclasp almost warmly.</p>

<p>"I'll go," he said. "I'll catch the ten o'clock
train, and to-night I'll sleep at an hotel, at the
Grosvenor&mdash;that's close to the station. It will be
more convenient for the train."</p>

<p>As Father Murchison went home that night he
kept thinking of that sentence: "It will be more
convenient for the train." The weakness in Guildea
that had prompted its utterance appalled him.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> letter came to Father Murchison from the
Professor during the next few days, and this silence
reassured him, for it seemed to betoken that all
was well. The day of the lecture dawned, and
passed. On the following morning, the Father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
eagerly opened the Times, and scanned its pages
to see if there were any report of the great meeting
of scientific men which Guildea had addressed.
He glanced up and down the columns with anxious
eyes, then suddenly his hands stiffened as
they held the sheets. He had come upon the following
paragraph:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We regret to announce that Professor Frederic
Guildea was suddenly seized with severe illness
yesterday evening while addressing a scientific
meeting in Paris. It was observed that he
looked very pale and nervous when he rose to his
feet. Nevertheless, he spoke in French fluently
for about a quarter of an hour. Then he appeared
to become uneasy. He faltered and glanced
about like a man apprehensive, or in severe distress.
He even stopped once or twice, and seemed
unable to go on, to remember what he wished to
say. But, pulling himself together with an obvious
effort, he continued to address the audience. Suddenly,
however, he paused again, edged furtively
along the platform, as if pursued by something
which he feared, struck out with his hands, uttered
a loud, harsh cry and fainted. The sensation in
the hall was indescribable. People rose from their
seats. Women screamed, and, for a moment,
there was a veritable panic. It is feared that the
Professor's mind must have temporarily given way
owing to overwork. We understand that he will
return to England as soon as possible, and we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
sincerely hope that necessary rest and quiet will
soon have the desired effect, and that he will be
completely restored to health and enabled to prosecute
further the investigations which have
already so benefited the world."</p></div>

<p>The Father dropped the paper, hurried out into
Bird Street, sent a wire of enquiry to Paris, and
received the same day the following reply: "Returning
to-morrow. Please call evening. Guildea."
On that evening the Father called in Hyde
Park Place, was at once admitted, and found Guildea
sitting by the fire in the library, ghastly pale,
with a heavy rug over his knees. He looked like
a man emaciated by a long and severe illness, and
in his wide open eyes there was an expression of
fixed horror. The Father started at the sight of
him, and could scarcely refrain from crying out.
He was beginning to express his sympathy when
Guildea stopped him with a trembling gesture.</p>

<p>"I know all that," Guildea said, "I know.
This Paris affair&mdash;&mdash;" He faltered and stopped.</p>

<p>"You ought never to have gone," said the
Father. "I was wrong. I ought not to have advised
your going. You were not fit."</p>

<p>"I was perfectly fit," he answered, with the irritability
of sickness. "But I was&mdash;I was accompanied
by that abominable thing."</p>

<p>He glanced hastily round him, shifted his chair
and pulled the rug higher over his knees. The
Father wondered why he was thus wrapped up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
For the fire was bright and red and the night was
not very cold.</p>

<p>"I was accompanied to Paris," he continued,
pressing his upper teeth upon his lower lip.</p>

<p>He paused again, obviously striving to control
himself. But the effort was vain. There was no
resistance in the man. He writhed in his chair
and suddenly burst forth in a tone of hopeless
lamentation.</p>

<p>"Murchison, this being, thing&mdash;whatever it is&mdash;no
longer leaves me even for a moment. It will
not stay here unless I am here, for it loves me,
persistently, idiotically. It accompanied me to
Paris, stayed with me there, pursued me to the
lecture hall, pressed against me, caressed me
while I was speaking. It has returned with me
here. It is here now,"&mdash;he uttered a sharp cry,&mdash;"now,
as I sit here with you. It is nestling up
to me, fawning upon me, touching my hands.
Man, man, can't you feel that it is here?"</p>

<p>"No," the Father answered truly.</p>

<p>"I try to protect myself from its loathsome
contact," Guildea continued, with fierce excitement,
clutching the thick rug with both hands.
"But nothing is of any avail against it. Nothing.
What is it? What can it be? Why should it
have come to me that night?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps as a punishment," said the Father,
with a quick softness.</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>"You hated affection. You put human feelings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
aside with contempt. You had, you desired
to have, no love for anyone. Nor did you desire
to receive any love from anything. Perhaps this
is a punishment."</p>

<p>Guildea stared into his face.</p>

<p>"D'you believe that?" he cried.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the Father. "But it may
be so. Try to endure it, even to welcome it.
Possibly then the persecution will cease."</p>

<p>"I know it means me no harm," Guildea exclaimed,
"it seeks me out of affection. It was
led to me by some amazing attraction which I exercise
over it ignorantly. I know that. But to a
man of my nature that is the ghastly part of the
matter. If it would hate me, I could bear it. If
it would attack me, if it would try to do me some
dreadful harm, I should become a man again. I
should be braced to fight against it. But this
gentleness, this abominable solicitude, this brainless
worship of an idiot, persistent, sickly, horribly
physical, I cannot endure. What does it
want of me? What would it demand of me? It
nestles to me. It leans against me. I feel its
touch, like the touch of a feather, trembling about
my heart, as if it sought to number my pulsations,
to find out the inmost secrets of my impulses and
desires. No privacy is left to me." He sprang
up excitedly. "I cannot withdraw," he cried, "I
cannot be alone, untouched, unworshipped, unwatched
for even one-half second. Murchison, I
am dying of this, I am dying."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>He sank down again in his chair, staring apprehensively
on all sides, with the passion of some
blind man, deluded in the belief that by his furious
and continued effort he will attain sight. The
Father knew well that he sought to pierce the
veil of the invisible, and have knowledge of the
thing that loved him.</p>

<p>"Guildea," the Father said, with insistent earnestness,
"try to endure this&mdash;do more&mdash;try to
give this thing what it seeks."</p>

<p>"But it seeks my love."</p>

<p>"Learn to give it your love and it may go, having
received what it came for."</p>

<p>"T'sh! You talk as a priest. Suffer your persecutors.
Do good to them that despitefully use
you. You talk as a priest."</p>

<p>"As a friend I spoke naturally, indeed, right out
of my heart. The idea suddenly came to me that
all this,&mdash;truth or seeming, it doesn't matter which,&mdash;may
be some strange form of lesson. I have
had lessons&mdash;painful ones. I shall have many
more. If you could welcome&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can't! I can't!" Guildea cried fiercely.
"Hatred! I can give it that,&mdash;always that, nothing
but that&mdash;hatred, hatred."</p>

<p>He raised his voice, glared into the emptiness
of the room, and repeated, "Hatred!"</p>

<p>As he spoke the waxen pallor of his cheeks increased,
until he looked like a corpse with living
eyes. The Father feared that he was going to
collapse and faint, but suddenly he raised himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
upon his chair and said, in a high and keen voice,
full of suppressed excitement:</p>

<p>"Murchison, Murchison!"</p>

<p>"Yes. What is it?"</p>

<p>An amazing ecstasy shone in Guildea's eyes.</p>

<p>"It wants to leave me," he cried. "It wants to
go! Don't lose a moment! Let it out! The
window&mdash;the window!"</p>

<p>The Father, wondering, went to the near window,
drew aside the curtains and pushed it open.
The branches of the trees in the garden creaked
drily in the light wind. Guildea leaned forward
on the arms of his chair. There was silence for
a moment. Then Guildea, speaking in a rapid
whisper, said,</p>

<p>"No, no. Open this door&mdash;open the hall door.
I feel&mdash;I feel that it will return the way it came.
Make haste&mdash;ah, go!"</p>

<p>The Father obeyed&mdash;to soothe him, hurried to
the door and opened it wide. Then he glanced
back at Guildea. He was standing up, bent forward.
His eyes were glaring with eager expectation,
and, as the Father turned, he made a furious
gesture towards the passage with his thin hands.</p>

<p>The Father hastened out and down the stairs.
As he descended in the twilight he fancied he
heard a slight cry from the room behind him, but
he did not pause. He flung the hall door open,
standing back against the wall. After waiting a
moment&mdash;to satisfy Guildea, he was about to close
the door again, and had his hand on it, when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
was attracted irresistibly to look forth towards the
park. The night was lit by a young moon, and,
gazing through the railings, his eyes fell upon a
bench beyond them.</p>

<p>Upon this bench something was sitting, huddled
together very strangely.</p>

<p>The Father remembered instantly Guildea's description
of that former night, that night of Advent,
and a sensation of horror-stricken curiosity
stole through him.</p>

<p>Was there then really something that had indeed
come to the Professor? And had it finished
its work, fulfilled its desire and gone back to its
former existence?</p>

<p>The Father hesitated a moment in the doorway.
Then he stepped out resolutely and crossed the
road, keeping his eyes fixed upon this black or
dark object that leaned so strangely upon the
bench. He could not tell yet what it was like, but
he fancied it was unlike anything with which his
eyes were acquainted. He reached the opposite
path, and was about to pass through the gate in
the railings, when his arm was brusquely grasped.
He started, turned round, and saw a policeman
eyeing him suspiciously.</p>

<p>"What are you up to?" said the policeman.</p>

<p>The Father was suddenly aware that he had no
hat upon his head, and that his appearance, as he
stole forward in his cassock, with his eyes intently
fixed upon the bench in the Park, was probably
unusual enough to excite suspicion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's all right, policeman," he answered, quickly,
thrusting some money into the constable's hand.</p>

<p>Then, breaking from him, the Father hurried
towards the bench, bitterly vexed at the interruption.
When he reached it nothing was there.
Guildea's experience had been almost exactly repeated
and, filled with unreasonable disappointment,
the Father returned to the house, entered
it, shut the door and hastened up the narrow stairway
into the library.</p>

<p>On the hearthrug, close to the fire, he found
Guildea lying with his head lolled against the armchair
from which he had recently risen. There
was a shocking expression of terror on his convulsed
face. On examining him the Father found
that he was dead.</p>

<p>The doctor, who was called in, said that the
cause of death was failure of the heart.</p>

<p>When Father Murchison was told this, he murmured:</p>

<p>"Failure of the heart! It was that then!"</p>

<p>He turned to the doctor and said:</p>

<p>"Could it have been prevented?"</p>

<p>The doctor drew on his gloves and answered:</p>

<p>"Possibly, if it had been taken in time. Weakness
of the heart requires a great deal of care.
The Professor was too much absorbed in his work.
He should have lived very differently."</p>

<p>The Father nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he said, sadly.</p>

<h2 class="hd1">THE LADY AND THE BEGGAR.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> in life is more rare than the conversion
of a person who is "close" about money into
one generous, open-handed and lavish. The sparrow
will sooner become the peacock than the miser
the spendthrift. And if this is so, if such a transformation
seldom occurs in life, it is even more
unusual for a man or woman to leave behind in
dying a manifesto which contradicts in set terms
the obvious and universally recognised tendency
of their whole existence. Naturally, therefore, the
provisions of Mrs. Errington's will surprised the
world. Old gentlemen in Clubs stared upon the
number of the Illustrated London News which announced
the disposal of her money as they might
have stared upon the head of Medusa. The fidgety
seemed turned to stone as they read. The
thoughtless gaped. As for the thoughtful, this
will drove them to deep meditation, and set them
walking in a maze of surmises, from which they
found no outlet. One or two, religiously inclined,
recalled that saying concerning the rich individual
and the passage of a camel through a needle's
eye. Possibly it had come home to Mrs. Errington
upon her death-bed. Possibly, as her end
drew near she had perceived herself tower to camel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
size, the entrance to Paradise shrink to the circumference
which refuses to receive a thread manipulated
by an unsteady hand. Yes, yes; they
began to expand in unctuous conjecture that
merged into deliberate assertion, when some one
remarked that Mrs. Errington had died in exactly
three minutes of the rupture of a blood-vessel on
the brain. So this comfortable theory was exploded.
And no other seemed tenable. No other
explained the fact that this wealthy woman, notorious
during her life for her miserly disposition,
her neglect of charity, her curious hatred of the
poor and complete emancipation from the tender
shackles of philanthropy, bequeathed at death the
greater part of her fortune to the destitute of London,
and to the honest beggars whom fate persistently
castigates, whom even Labour declines to
accept as toilers at the meanest wage.</p>

<p>Only Horace Errington, the dead woman's sole
child, and Captain Hindford, of the Life Guards,
exactly knew the truth of the matter. And this
truth was so strange, and must have seemed so
definite a lie to the majority of mankind, that it
was never given to the world. Not even the rescued
poor who found themselves received into the
Errington Home as into some heaven with four
beautiful walls, knew why there had sprung up
such a home and why they were in it. The whole
affair was discussed ardently at the time, argued
about, contested, and dropped. Mystery veiled
it. Like many things that happen, it remained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
an inexplicable enigma to the world. And finally,
the world forgot it. But Horace Errington remembered
it, more especially when he heard light-hearted
people merrily laughing at certain strange
shadows of things unseen which will, at times, intrude
into the most frivolous societies, turning the
meditative to thoughts deep as dark and silent-flowing
rivers, the careless to frisky sneers and the
gibes which fly forth in flocks from the dense undergrowths
of ignorance.</p>

<p>The Erringtons were magnets, and irresistibly
attracted gold instead of steel. Mr. Errington
died comparatively young, overwhelmed by the
benefits showered upon him by Fortune, which
continued to dog persistently the steps of his
widow, whom he left with one child, Horace.
This boy was destined by his father's will to be a
millionaire, and had no need of any money from
his mother, so that, eventually, Mrs. Errington did
him no wrong by the bequest which so troubled
the curious. She was a brilliant and an attractive
woman, sparkling as a diamond, and apparently
as hard. That she loved Horace there was no
doubt, and he had adored her. Yet he could not
influence her as most only sons can influence their
mothers. She was liberally gifted with powers of
resistance, and in all directions opposed impenetrable
barriers to the mental or spiritual assaults
of those with whom she came in contact. It
seemed impossible for Mrs. Errington to receive,
like a waxen tablet, a definite impression. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
was so completely herself that she walked the
world as one clad in armour which turned aside
all weapons. This might have been partly the
reason why men found her so attractive, partly,
also, the reason why Horace considered her, even
while he was not yet acquainted with trousers, as so
very wonderful among women.</p>

<p>Among many indifferences, Mrs. Errington included
a definite indifference to the sufferings of
those less fortunate than herself. Legacies came
to her as often as mendicants to Victor Hugo's
Bishop of D&mdash;&mdash;. She received them with a quiet
greediness so prettily concealed at first that nobody
called it vulgar. As time went on this greediness
grew to gluttony. Mrs. Errington began to
feel that fatal influence which came upon the
man who built walls with his gold, and each day
longed to see the walls rise higher round him. A
passion for mere possession seized her and dominated
her. Even, she permitted the world, always
curiously nosing, like a dog, in people's gutters,
to become aware of this passion. This beautifully
dressed, gay and clever woman was known to be
an eager miser by her acquaintance first, and last
by her own son Horace. It is true that she spent
money on the so-called "good things" of life,
gave admirable dinners, and would as soon have
gone without clothes as without her opera-box.
But she practised an intense economy in many
secret and some public ways, and, more especially,
she was completely deaf to those appeals of suffering,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
and sometimes of charlatanry, which besiege
our ears in London, so full of wily outcasts and
of those who are terribly in need. Mrs. Errington's
name figured in no charitable lists. She
seldom even gave her patronage to a bazaar, and,
above all things, she positively abhorred the beggars
who make the streets and parks their hunting-grounds,
who hover before doorsteps, and grow
up from the ground, like mustard-seeds, when a
luggage-laden cab stops or a carriage unblessed
with a groom pauses before a shop.</p>

<p>Horace knew this hatred very well, so well that,
although his nature was as lavish as his mother's
was mean, he seldom sought to rouse any pity in
her pitiless heart, or to strike the rock from which
experience had taught him that no water would
gush out. Every habit of conduct, is, however,
broken through now and then, when the moment
is exceptional and the soul is deeply stirred. And
this reticent mood of the boy when with his
mother one day received a shock which drove him
into a contest with her, and moved him to strive
against the obedience which his love for her habitually
imposed upon him.</p>

<p>It was spring-time. Horace, now sixteen, and
long established at Eton, was at home for the
Easter vacation, which he was spending with Mrs.
Errington, not at their country place, but in her
town house in Park Lane. One morning, when
the City was smiling with sunshine, and was so
full of the breath of the sweet season that in quiet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
corners it seemed in some strange and indefinite
way almost Countrified, Horace went into Mrs.
Errington's boudoir and begged her to come out
for a walk in the Park, where he had already been
bicycling before breakfast. When there was no
question of money she was always ready to accede
to any request of the boy's, and she got up at once
from her writing-table&mdash;she was just sending a
short note of refusal to subscribe to some charity
pressed upon her attention by a hopeful clergyman&mdash;and
went to her room to put on her hat.
Five minutes later she and Horace set forth.</p>

<p>Weather may have a softening or a hardening
influence on the average person. On Mrs. Errington
it had neither. She felt much the same essentially
in a thunderstorm or in midsummer
moonlight, on a black, frost-bound winter's day,
or on such a perfect and tender spring morning as
that on which she now passed through the park-gate
with her son. She never drew weather into
her soul, but calmly recognised it as a fact suitable
for illustration on the first page of the Daily
Graphic. Now she walked gaily into the Row
with Horace, looking about her for acquaintances.
She found some, and would not have been sorry
to linger with them. But Horace wanted her to
go further afield, and accordingly they soon moved
on towards the Serpentine. It was when they
were just in sight of the water that they met Captain
Hindford, already alluded to as a man who
had eventually more knowledge than other people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
of the events which led to the drawing-up of Mrs.
Errington's strange will. He was one of the many
men who admired Mrs. Errington while wondering
at her narrow and excommunicative disposition.
And he stopped to speak to her with the
eager readiness which is so flattering to a woman.
The spring, so much discussed, was lightly discussed
again, and, by some inadvertence, no doubt,
Captain Hindford, who was almost as genial as if
he had lived in the days of Dickens, was led to
exclaim&mdash;</p>

<p>"By Jove, Mrs. Errington, this first sunshine's
as seductive as a pretty child&mdash;makes one ready
to do anything! Why, I saw an old crossing-sweeper
just now sweeping nothing at all&mdash;for it's
as dry as a bone, you see&mdash;and I had to fork out
a sixpence; encouraged useless industry just because
of the change in the weather, 'pon my word,
eh?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Errington's lips tightened ever so little.</p>

<p>"A great mistake, Captain Hindford," she said
drily.</p>

<p>Horace looked at his mother with a sort of
bright, boyish curiosity. Although he knew so
well what her nature was like, it did not cease to
surprise him.</p>

<p>"You think so?" said the Captain. "Well,
perhaps, you're right; I don't know. Daresay
I've been a fool. Still, you know a fool in sunshine
is better than a wise man in a fog; 'pon my
word, yes, eh?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Errington did not verbally agree, and they
parted after the Captain had accepted an invitation
to dine quietly in Park Lane that evening.</p>

<p>"Devilish odd woman, devilish odd!" was
Hindford's comment. And he watched the
mother's and son's retreating figures with a certain
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Wonder what the boy thinks of her?" he
muttered. "Jove, if there isn't a beggar going
after them! She'll soon settle him!"</p>

<p>And he remained standing to watch the encounter.
From where he stood he had seen the
beggar, who had been half-sitting, half-lying, on a
bench facing the water, glance up at Mrs. Errington
and her son as they passed, partially raise
himself up, gaze after them, and finally rise to his
feet and follow their footsteps. Hindford could
only see the man's back. It was long, slightly
bending, and apparently youngish. A thin but
scrupulously neat coat of some poor shiny and
black material covered it, and hung from the man's
shoulders loosely, forming two folds which were
almost like two gently rounded hills with a shallow
valley running between them up to the blades
of the shoulders. Certainly the coat didn't fit
very well. The Captain watched, expecting to
see this beggar address an appeal to Mrs. Errington
or Horace. But apparently the man was nervous
or half-hearted, for he followed them slowly,
without catching them up, until the trio vanished
from view on the bank of the Serpentine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>When this disappearance took place the Captain
was conscious of an absurd feeling of disappointment.
He could not understand why he felt any
anxiety to see Mrs. Errington refuse a beggar
alms. Yet he would gladly have followed, like a
spy, to behold a commonplace and dingy event.
Despite the apparent reluctance of the beggar to
ply his trade, Hindford felt convinced that presently
the man would approach Mrs. Errington and
be promptly sent about his business. Her negative
would, no doubt, be eager enough even upon
this exquisite and charitable morning. Wishing
devoutly that, being a gentleman, he had not to
conform to an unwritten code of manners, Hindford
walked away. And, as he walked, he saw
continually the back of the beggar with that black
coat of the two hills and the valley between the
shoulder-blades.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Errington and Horace, quite
unaware that they were being followed, pursued
their way. There were a few boats out on the
water, occupied by inexpert oarsmen whose frantic
efforts to seem natural and serene in this to them
new and complicated art drew the undivided attention
of the boy, a celebrated "wet Bob."
Mrs. Errington was thinking about her latest investments
and watching the golden walls grow
higher about her. Mother and son were engrossed,
and did not hear a low voice say, "I beg
your pardon!" until it had uttered the words
more than once. Then Horace looked round.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
He saw a tall and very pale young man, neatly
though poorly dressed in dark trousers and a thin
loose black coat that might have been made of
alpaca, and fitted badly. This man's face was
gaunt and meagre, the features were pointed, the
mouth was piteous. His eyes blazed with some
terrible emotion, it seemed, and when Horace
looked round a sudden patch of scarlet burned on
his white and bony cheeks. Horace's attention
was pinned by his appearance, which was at the
same time dull and piercing, as the human aspect
becomes in the tremendous moment of an existence.
This man's soul seemed silently screaming
out in his glance, his posture, his chalk-white
cheeks starred with scarlet spots, his long-fingered
hands drooping down in the shadow of his ill-fitting
coat, which fluttered in the breeze. Horace
turned, looked, and stood still. The man also
stood still. Mrs. Errington looked sharply round.</p>

<p>"What is it, Horace?" she said.</p>

<p>She glanced at the man, and her lips tightened.</p>

<p>"Come along, Horace," she said. "Come!"</p>

<p>But Horace, who seemed fascinated by the
spectre that had claimed their attention, still hesitated,
and the man, noticing this, half held out
one hand and murmured in a husky voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am starving."</p>

<p>With the words, the scarlet spots in his cheeks
deepened to a fiercer hue, and he hung his head
like one abruptly overwhelmed with shame.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>"For God's sake give me something!" he muttered.
"I've&mdash;I've never done this before."</p>

<p>Horace's hand went to his waistcoat pocket,
but before he could take out a coin Mrs. Errington
had decisively intervened.</p>

<p>"Horace, I forbid you," she said.</p>

<p>"Mater!"</p>

<p>"Understand&mdash;I forbid you."</p>

<p>She took his arm and they walked on, leaving
the man standing by the water-side. He did not
follow them or repeat his dismal statement, only
let his head drop forward on his bosom, while
his fingers twisted themselves convulsively together.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a hot argument was proceeding between
Mrs. Errington and Horace. For once it
seemed that the boy was inclined to defy his
mother.</p>

<p>"Let me give him something&mdash;only a few coppers,"
he said.</p>

<p>"No; beggars ought not to be encouraged."</p>

<p>"That chap isn't a regular beggar. I'll wager
anything it's true. He is starving."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! They always say so."</p>

<p>"Mater&mdash;stop! I must&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Horace paused resolutely and looked round. In
the distance the man could still be seen standing
where they had left him, his head drooped, his
narrow shoulders hunched slightly forward.</p>

<p>"Let me run back," the boy went on; "I won't
be a minute."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>But Mrs. Errington's curious parsimony was
roused now to full activity.</p>

<p>"I will not allow it," she said; "the man is
probably a thief and a drunkard. Hyde Park
swarms with bad characters."</p>

<p>"Bad character or not, he's starving. Anyone
can see that."</p>

<p>"Then let him starve. It's his own fault. Let
him starve! Nobody need unless they have committed
some folly, or, worse, some crime. There's
bread enough for all who deserve to live. I have
no sympathy with all this preposterous pauperising
which goes by the name of charity. It's a
fad, a fashion&mdash;nothing more."</p>

<p>She forced her son to walk on. As they went
he cast a last glance back at the beggar.</p>

<p>"Mater, you're cruel!" he said, moved by a
strength of emotion that was unusual in him&mdash;"hard
and cruel!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Errington made no reply. She had gained
her point, and cared for little else.</p>

<p>"You'll repent this some day," Horace continued.</p>

<p>He was in a passion, and scarcely knew what he
was saying. Strings seemed drawn tightly round
his heart, and angry tears rose to his eyes.</p>

<p>"You'll repent it, I bet!" he added.</p>

<p>Then he relapsed into silence, feeling that if he
spoke again he would lose all the self-control that
a boy of sixteen thinks so much of.</p>

<p>All that day Horace thought incessantly of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
beggar, and felt an increasing sense of anger
against his mother. He found himself looking
furtively at her, as one looks at a stranger, and
thinking her face hard and pitiless. She seemed
to him as someone whom he had never really
known till now, as some one whom, now that he
knew her, he feared. Why his mind dwelt so
perpetually upon a casual beggar he couldn't understand.
But so it was. He saw perpetually the
man's white face, fierce and ashamed eyes, the
gesture at once hungry and abashed with which
he asked for charity. All day the vision haunted
the boy in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Mrs. Errington, on her part, calmly ignored the
incident of the morning and appeared not to
notice any change in her son's demeanour. In the
evening Captain Hindford came to dine. He was
struck by Horace's glumness, and in his frank way
openly chaffed the boy about it.</p>

<p>"What's up with this young scoundrel?" he
said to Mrs. Errington.</p>

<p>Horace grew very red.</p>

<p>"Horace is not very well to-day," said his
mother.</p>

<p>"Mater, that's not true&mdash;I'm all right."</p>

<p>"I think it more charitable to suppose you
seedy," she replied.</p>

<p>"Charitable!" Horace cried. "Well, Mater,
what on earth do you know about charity?"</p>

<p>Captain Hindford began to look embarrassed,
and endeavoured to change the subject, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
Horace suddenly burst out into the story of the
beggar.</p>

<p>"It was just after you left us," he said to the
Captain.</p>

<p>"I saw the fellow following you," the Captain
said. Then he turned to Mrs. Errington. "These
chaps are the plague of the Park," he added.</p>

<p>"Exactly. That is what I tell Horace."</p>

<p>"I don't care!" the boy said stoutly. "He <i>was</i>
starving, and we were brutes not to give him
something. The Mater'll be sorry for it some day.
I know it. I can feel it."</p>

<p>Captain Hindford began to talk about French
plays rather hastily.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Errington went up to the drawing-room,
Horace suddenly said to the Captain&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, Hindford, do me a good turn to-night,
will you?"</p>

<p>"Well, old chap, what is it, eh?"</p>

<p>"When you say 'good-night,' don't really go."</p>

<p>The Captain looked astonished.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Wait outside a second for me. When the
Mater's gone to bed I want you to come into the
Park with me."</p>

<p>"The Park? What for?"</p>

<p>"To find that beggar chap. I bet he's there.
Lots of his sort sleep there, you know. I want
to give him something. And&mdash;somehow&mdash;I'd like
you to come with me. Besides, it doesn't do to
go looking for anyone in the Park alone at night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's true," the Captain said. "All right,
Errington; I'll come."</p>

<p>And, after bidding Mrs. Errington good-night,
he lingered in Park Lane till he was joined by
Horace. They turned at once into the Park and
began to make their way in the direction of the
Serpentine. It was a soft night, full of the fine
and minute rain that belongs especially to spring
weather. The clocks of the town had struck
eleven, and most of the legitimate sweethearts
who make the Park their lover's walk had gone
home, leaving this realm of lawns and trees and
waters to the night-birds, the pickpockets, the
soldiers, and the unhealthily curious persons over
whom it exercises such a continual and gloomy
fascination. Hindford and Horace could have
seen many piteous sights had they cared to as
they walked down the long path by the Row.
The boy peered at each seat as they passed, and
once or twice hesitated by some thin and tragic
figure, stretched in uneasy slumber or bowed in
staring reverie face to face with the rainy night.
But from each in turn he drew back, occasionally
followed by a muttered oath or a sharp ejaculation.</p>

<p>"I bet he'll be somewhere by the Serpentine,"
the boy said to Hindford.</p>

<p>And they walked on till at length they reached
the black sheet of water closely muffled in the
night.</p>

<p>"We met him somewhere just here," Horace
said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know," Hindford rejoined. "He got up
from this seat. But he may be a dozen miles off
by now."</p>

<p>"No," Horace said, with a curious pertinacity;
"I'm sure he's about here still. He looked like
a man with no home. Ugh! how dreary it is!
Come along, Hindford."</p>

<p>The good-natured Captain obeyed, and they
went on by the cheerless water, which was only
partially revealed in the blackness. Suddenly they
both stopped.</p>

<p>"What's that?" Horace exclaimed.</p>

<p>A shrill whistle, followed by shouts, came to
them, apparently from the water. Then there
was an answering whistle from somewhere in the
Park.</p>

<p>"It's the police," said Hindford. "There's
something up."</p>

<p>They hurried on, and in a moment saw what
looked like a great black shadow, rising out of the
water, lifting in his arms another shadow, which
drooped and hung down with the little waves
curling round it. As they drew close they saw
that the first shadow was a policeman, up to his
waist in the water, and the second shadow was a
man whom he held in his arms, as he waded with
difficulty to the shore.</p>

<p>"Lend a hand, mates," he shouted as he saw
them.</p>

<p>Just then a light shone out over the black lake
from the bull's-eye of a second policeman who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
had hurried up in answer to his comrade's whistle.
Between them they quickly got the man on shore,
and laid him down on the path on his back. The
bull's-eye lantern, turned full on him, lit up a face
that seemed all bony structure, staring eyes, a
mouth out of which the water dripped. He had
no coat on and his thin arms were like those of a
skeleton.</p>

<p>"Dead as a door-nail," said the first policeman.
"A case of suicide."</p>

<p>"God! Hindford, it's he! It's the chap who
asked me for money this morning!" whispered
Horace. "Is he really dead?"</p>

<p>The Captain, who had been examining the body
and feeling the heart, nodded. Horace gazed
upon the white face with a sort of awful curiosity.
He had never before looked at a corpse.</p>

<p>"Look here, Errington," Hindford said to the
boy that night as he parted from him in Park
Lane, "don't tell your mother anything of this."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but, Hindford&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come, now, you take my advice. Keep a
quiet tongue in your head."</p>

<p>"But perhaps it was her fault; it was&mdash;if we'd
given the poor chap something he'd&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Probably. That's just the reason I don't want
you to tell Mrs. Errington anything of it. Come,
promise me on your honour."</p>

<p>"All right, Hindford, I'll promise. How horrible
it's all been!"</p>

<p>"Don't think about it, lad. Good-night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>Horace trembled as he stole up the black staircase
to bed. He meant to keep his promise, of
course, but he wondered whether the Mater would
have owned that she was in the wrong that morning
if she had heard his dreary tale of the beggar's
death in the night.</p>

<p>The next day it was Mrs. Errington who asked
Horace to go out walking. She looked rather
pale and fatigued at breakfast, but declared her
intention of taking a constitutional.</p>

<p>"Come with me, Horace," she said.</p>

<p>"Very well," he answered, with a curious and
almost shy boyish coldness.</p>

<p>"Not into the Park, Mater," he said, as they
were starting.</p>

<p>"Why not? We always walk there. Where
else should we go?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere&mdash;shopping&mdash;Regent Street."</p>

<p>"No, Horace, I've got a headache to-day. I
want a quiet place."</p>

<p>He didn't say more. They set out, and Mrs.
Errington took the precise route they had followed
the day before. She glanced rather sharply about
her as they walked. Presently they reached the
seat on which the beggar had been sitting just before
he got up to follow them. Mrs. Errington
paused beside it.</p>

<p>"I'm tired. Let us sit down here," she said.</p>

<p>"No, Mater, not here."</p>

<p>"Really, Horace," Mrs. Errington said, "you
are in an extraordinary mood to-day. You have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
no regard for me. What is the matter with
you?"</p>

<p>And she sat down on the seat. Horace remained
standing.</p>

<p>"I shan't sit here," he said obstinately.</p>

<p>"Very well," Mrs. Errington replied.</p>

<p>She really began to look ill, but Horace was too
much preoccupied with his own feelings to notice
it. There was something abominable to him in
his mother sitting calmly down to rest in the very
place occupied a few hours ago by the wretched
creature who had, so Horace believed, been driven
to death by her refusal of charity. He felt sick
with horror in that neighbourhood, and he moved
away, and stood staring across the Serpentine.
Presently Mrs. Errington called to him in a faint
voice&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Horace, come and give me your hand."</p>

<p>He turned, noticed her extreme pallor, and ran
up.</p>

<p>"What's the row? Are you ill, Mater?"</p>

<p>"No. Help me up." He put out his hand.
She got up slowly.</p>

<p>"We'll go home," he said. "You look awfully
seedy."</p>

<p>"No; let us walk on."</p>

<p>In spite of his remonstrances she insisted on
walking up and down at the edge of the Serpentine
for quite an hour. She appeared to be on the
look-out for somebody. Over and over again they
passed the spot where the beggar had drowned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
himself. Their feet trod over the ground on
which his dead body had been laid. Each time
they reached it Horace felt himself grow cold.
Death is so terrible to the young. At last Mrs.
Errington stopped.</p>

<p>"I can't walk much more," she said.</p>

<p>"Then do let's go home now," Horace said.</p>

<p>She stood looking round her, searching the Park
with her eyes.</p>

<p>"I suppose we must," she said slowly. Then
she added, "We can come here again to-morrow."</p>

<p>Horace was puzzled.</p>

<p>"What for? Why should we?" he asked.</p>

<p>But his mother made no reply, and they walked
home.</p>

<p>Next day she insisted on going again to the
same place, and again she was obviously on the
look-out. Horace grew more and more puzzled
by her demeanour. And when the third day came,
and once more Mrs. Errington called him to set
forth to the Serpentine, he said to her, with a boy's
bluntness&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"D'you want to meet someone there?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Errington looked at him strangely.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, after a minute's silence.</p>

<p>"Why, who is it?"</p>

<p>"That beggar I wouldn't let you give money
to."</p>

<p>Horace turned scarlet with the shock of surprise
and the knowledge&mdash;which he absurdly felt as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
guilty knowledge&mdash;that the man was dead, perhaps
even buried by now.</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense, Mater!" he began, stammering.
"He won't come there again. Besides, you never
give to beggars."</p>

<p>"I mean to give this man something."</p>

<p>Horace was more and more surprised.</p>

<p>"Why?" he exclaimed. "Why now? You
wouldn't when I wanted you to, and now&mdash;now
it's too late. What do you wish to give to him
for now?"</p>

<p>But all she would say was, "I feel that I should
like to, that&mdash;that his perhaps really was a deserving
case. Come, Horace, let us go and try to find
him."</p>

<p>And the boy, bound by his word to Captain
Hindford, was forced to go out in search of a dead
man. He felt the horror of this quest. To-day
Mrs. Errington carried her purse in her hand, and
looked eagerly out for the beggar. Once she
fancied she saw him in the distance.</p>

<p>"There he is!" she cried to Horace. "Run
and fetch him."</p>

<p>The boy turned pale, and stared.</p>

<p>"Where, Mater?"</p>

<p>"Among those trees."</p>

<p>"It can't be! Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"No," she said; "you are right. I made a
mistake. It's only somebody like him. Why,
Horace, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he answered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>But he was shaking. The business was too
ghastly. He felt he couldn't stand it much
longer, and he resolved to go to Captain Hindford
and persuade the Captain to absolve him from
his promise. In the afternoon of the same day,
accordingly, he went off to Knightsbridge. He
rang, and was told that Captain Hindford had
gone to Paris and was afterwards going for a tour
on the Continent. His heart sank at the news.
Was he to go on day after day searching with
his mother for this corpse, which was rotting in
the grave? He asked for Hindford's address. It
was Poste Restante, Monte Carlo. But the servant
added that letters sent there might have to
wait for two or three days, as his master's immediate
plans were unsettled. Horace, however,
went to the nearest telegraph-office and wired to
Hindford&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let me off promise; urgent.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Horace Errington.</span>"</p>

<p>Then, having done all he could, he went back
to Park Lane. He found his mother in a curiously
restless state, and directly he came in she began
to talk about the beggar.</p>

<p>"I must and will find that man," she said.</p>

<p>"Mater, why?"</p>

<p>"Because I shall never be well till I do," she
said. "I don't know what it is, but I cannot be
still by day, and I cannot rest by night, for thinking
of him. Why did I not let you give him
something?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mater, I wish to God you had!" the boy said
solemnly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Errington did not seem to notice his unusual
manner. She was self-engrossed.</p>

<p>"However, we shall see him again, no doubt,"
she went on. "And then I shall give him something
handsome. I know he needs it."</p>

<p>Horace went hastily out of the room. He
longed for a wire from Captain Hindford. Next
day he "shammed ill," as he called it to himself,
so as to get out of going into the Park. So Mrs.
Errington went off by herself in a condition of
almost feverish anticipation.</p>

<p>"I know I shall see him to-day," she said, as she
left Horace.</p>

<p>She returned at lunch-time, and came up at once
to his room.</p>

<p>"I have seen him," she said.</p>

<p>Horace sat up, staring at her in blank amazement.</p>

<p>"What, Mater? What d'you say?"</p>

<p>"I have seen him."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I went to the place where he asked you
for money, and walked up and down for ages.
But he wasn't there. At last I gave it up and
crossed the bridge. I took it into my head to
come home on the other side of the water. Well,
when I was half-way along it, I looked across, and
there I saw him."</p>

<p>"Rot, Mater!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>"He was standing alone by the water, staring
straight across at me, just as if he saw me and was
trying to attract my attention."</p>

<p>"No, no!"</p>

<p>"Horace, don't be silly! Why do you contradict
me? He looked just the same as when we
saw him first, only he had no coat on."</p>

<p>Horace gave a sort of gasp.</p>

<p>"I suppose his poverty had compelled him to
pawn it," Mrs. Errington continued. "Don't you
think so, Horace? People can pawn clothes,
can't they?"</p>

<p>The boy nodded. His eyes were fixed on her.</p>

<p>"I looked across at him," Mrs. Errington continued,
"and made a sign to him to come round
to meet me by the other end, near the Row. I
held up my purse so that he might understand
me."</p>

<p>"What did he do?"</p>

<p>"He turned away and hurried off among the
trees."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"Do you know, Horace," Mrs. Errington continued
rather excitedly, "I think if you had beckoned
to him he would have come. He's afraid of
me, perhaps, because&mdash;because I wouldn't let you
give to him. To-morrow you must come out with
me. Till I've relieved that man's wants I shall
have no peace."</p>

<p>She hastened out of the room, apparently in a
quiver of unusual agitation. Horace sat petrified.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
If only Hindford would telegraph! That cursed
promise!</p>

<p>On the following day it rained. Nevertheless,
Mrs. Errington almost violently insisted upon
Horace accompanying her to search for the
beggar.</p>

<p>"We shall go to the far side of the water," she
said. "I believe when we go to the other side he
sees us coming and avoids us. But if we can catch
sight of him, as I did yesterday, you can beckon
to him, and I am certain when he sees you he will
come."</p>

<p>Horace said nothing. He felt cold about the
heart, not so much with fear as with awe and
wonder. They went to the far bank, and almost
directly Mrs. Errington cried out&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"There he is, and without his coat again! How
wet he must be getting!"</p>

<p>Horace looked across the dull water, through
the driving rain. He saw no one on the opposite
bank.</p>

<p>"He sees us," Mrs. Errington added. "Horace,
you beckon to him. Here, take my purse. Hold
it up, and then point to him to come round and
meet us."</p>

<p>Mechanically the boy obeyed.</p>

<p>"Ah, I knew it! This time he is coming," said
Mrs. Errington.</p>

<p>"He is coming, Mater?"</p>

<p>"Yes; come along."</p>

<p>She hurried towards the end of the Serpentine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
Horace walked by her side, staring in horror
through the rain.</p>

<p>"Poor man!" Mrs. Errington said presently.
"How ghastly he looks!"</p>

<p>"Mater&mdash;I say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Is he near?"</p>

<p>"Near?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Errington stopped in amazement.</p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean, Horace?"</p>

<p>"What I say. Is he near now?"</p>

<p>"Near? He's just coming up."</p>

<p>Suddenly the boy fainted.</p>

<p>When he came to he was lying in the shelter of
the Rescue Society.</p>

<p>"Ah, Horace," his mother said, "you ought to
have stayed in bed another day."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mater."</p>

<p>"You frightened that poor man. He made off
when you fainted."</p>

<p>That evening Horace received a telegram from
Monte Carlo&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very well but better say nothing.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hindford.</span>"</p>

<p>He read it, laid it down, and told Mrs. Errington
the truth.</p>

<hr class="hr1" />

<p>As already stated, she died very suddenly not
long afterwards, leaving behind her the will which
so astonished London.</p>
